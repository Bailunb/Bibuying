Every child in Valoran has heard the tale before
About the crused mummy boy
who felt his heart no more
So sad and lorn, the helpless lad
Amumu was his name
He ventured out to find a friend
and learn about his bane

For many years, young Amumu traveled through the lands
Determined to make friends, if only they would understand
But even when Amumu stood upon the ledge of home
His hope would disappoint him
and he would remain alone
But then the curse began to whisper in his ear
And would confirm what was Amumu's biggest fear
It pledged that never shall someone become his friend
It pledged that he shall be alone until his end
The sorrow and despair
Became too much to bear
Yeah..ah...

The moment when Amumu
realized what he had done
Too late it was, for him, for them
the evil curse had won
The anger and the anguish overwhelmed his fragile soul
And caused a wicked tantrum that he never could control



Blah blah blablah.
Wanna join me, come and play.
But I might shoot you, in your face.
Bombs and bullets will, do the trick.
What do we need here, is a little bit of panic!

Do you ever wanna catch me?
Right now I'm feeling ignored!
So can you try a little harder?
I'm really getting bored!

Come on, shoot faster,
Just a little bit of energy!
I wanna try something fun right now,
I guess some people call it anarchy!
Let's blow this city to ashes,
And see what Pow-Pow thinks.
It's such pathetic neatness,
But not for long 'cause it'll get jinxed!

So much better, so much fun.
Let's start from scratch and, blow up the sun!

Come on, shoot faster,
Just a little bit of energy!
I wanna try something fun right now,
I guess some people call it anarchy!
Let's blow this city to ashes,
And see what Pow-Pow thinks.
It's such pathetic neatness,
But not for long 'cause it'll get jinxed!
Come on!
Come on!
And get jinxed!














Ah~Ah~
Do we fight to hold our heads up high?
And beat the drum to what we love?
Risk the fall?oh we have felt it all,
Come crashing down from far above.
Stars arising, countless worlds colliding,
Only one will take it all.
Can we bring to fall the giants?
Can we make the final call?
We are the ones,
To ignite the darkened skies.
The champions,
Of a world that we defy.
A solemn reign,
Of the few who rise up high,
And we all fight,
At the last light.
Ah~Ah~






We were born from light before there even was a dawn
So pure  so bright
Falling from the skies above into our darkened fate
The time has come
Walking through this world we bear the secret of our lives
The light we share
Caught in destiny we shine for we are meant to be
The Star Guardians
Gone in a flash before our time
Up in the skies together
The vow we have made has kept us strong
Don't fade away it's time to shine
Burning bright
As we reach out for the same horizon
Burning brighter
Runnin outta time,we're chasing the light
Gone in a flash before our time
Up in the skies together
The vow we have made has kept us strong
Don't fade away it's time to shine
Burning bright
As we reach out for the same horizon
Burning brighter
Piercing through the dawn,we burn on and on (and on)
The thought of us stuck in my mind
I long for the days when we were young
The song in my heart, the light in your eyes
But now I drown in tears I’ve cried
Yelling your name into the rain
Don’t push me away, let’s head for the sky!
Gone in a flash before our time
Up in the skies together
The vow we have made has kept us strong
Don't fade away it's time to shine
Burning bright
As we reach out for the same horizon
Burning brighter
Runnin outta time, we’re chasing the light
Burning bright
As we reach out for the same horizon
Burning brighter
Piercing through the dawn,we burn on and on (and on)
涙よ星に　瞬きを伝えて
守るものがあるから　きっと強くなれる
語るべき物語(ことば)失くした　星の守護者(まもりて)は　
時間(とき)の果て　夢の果て　闇に立ちすくんだ
風を読んでみたんだ
虚空(そら)に向けて誰かを呼んでみたんだ
光求めた solitude
微(かす)かなresonance 確かに届くromance
そんな 流れ星たちを　抱きとめた
明日(あす)が見えなくたって　乗り越えなくちゃって
奇跡の軌跡描き
未来へ繋ぐglowing heart
心のphotonが　銀河に零れて
決意(みち)を強く照らすBurning bright

それぞれの思い秘めた　星の守護者(まもりて)は
空からの　呼ぶ声に　導かれた
重ねる手と手には
言葉なんかより伝わることがある
熱い心 通じ合った
確かなresonance 見つけるのはessence
目指した 意識の先がdestination
答えが見えなくって　挫けそうになって
支え合い　誓い合う
絆で繋ぐ shining smile
心のphotonが 銀河にあふれて
運命(みち)を開く鍵は my starlike heart
明日(あす)が見えなくたって 乗り越えなくちゃって
奇跡の軌跡描き
未来へ繋ぐglowing heart
心のphotonが 銀河に溢れて
運命(みち)が開いたら…！
羽ばたいてゆこうよ 乗り越えてゆこうよ
星空と溶け合って
いつまでも行ける Fly high
真っ直ぐ願いを世界に歌って
新しい夜も 新しい朝も
ここからまたはじめよう

飛び立て
Do we fight to hold our heads up high
And beat the drum to what we love?
Risk the fall, oh we have felt it all
Come crashing down from far above
Stars arising, countless worlds colliding
Only one will take it all
Can we bring to fall the giants
Can we make the final call
We are the ones
To ignite the darkened skies
The champions
Of a world that we defy
A solemn reign
Of the few who rise up high
And we all fight
At the last light
Hearing voices from afar
Join the madness when the curtain falls
Risk it all, hold nothing back
Seize the day, we must attack
Stars arising, countless worlds colliding
Only one will take it all
Can we bring to fall the giants
Can we make the final call
We are the ones...
Can we bring to fall the giants
Can we bring to fall the giants
Can we bring to fall the giants
We are the ones
To ignite the darkened skies
Can we bring to fall the giants
Can we bring to fall the giants



Written by：Pentakill

Blinded by hate brought by the fall

As I swear death to all
You will feel my vengeance
As I claim your mortal soul

I will punish and destroy
Those responsible for this ploy

I will seek a thousand deaths
I will bring a thousand years of war
All that I had taken away

My home is gone and my loved ones slain
For every sleep claims a piece of me

Every waking moment every single dream

As the masses came
Like a shadow through this land

They laid siege to all we ever had

I stood strong I was honor bound

I stand defiant I stand ever proud

I am the chosen
I am the guardian the guardian

Now I seek the blood of those

Who claimed the innocent

I will hunt the enemy to the last

I will banish and rejoice
The final breath of foes

You will see what you have made
You will see what I have finally become
All that I had laid to the waste

My spirit broken and just memories remain

For every day claims a piece of me

Every waking hour claims my inner peace

My inner peace

As the masses came
Like a shadow through this land

They laid siege to all we ever had

I stood strong I was honor bound

I stand defiant I stand ever proud

I am the chosen
I am the guardian the guardian
Dark smoke exhales, From the mountain half
And wind blows through hollow dells
Skies clear as day, shall soon turn gray
And you'll know, you're nearing Ornn
Barring your path is a chasm wide
Howls rise from fathomless pits
But close stands a bridge, frozen by time
And across, you'll soon find Ornn
River of fire, that Scorches the earth
Belies his kingdom of stone
And steel sings its tone, as a god stands alone
The shaping hand, we know as Ornn
Sparks leap and fly from the star-fallen ore
Forging his works, divine
Bellows Erupt, with unbridled force
No longer lost - the Mountainsmith, Ornn


Legends never die when the world is callin' you
 Can you hear them screaming out your name?
 Legends never die
 They never lose hope when everything's cold
 And the fighting's near
 It's deep in their bones
 They run into smoke when the fire is fierce
 Oh, pick yourself up 'cause

 Legends never die
 Legends never die
 Legends never die
 Legends never die
 Legends never die
 They're written down in eternity
 But you'll never see the price it costs – the scars collected all their lives
 When everything's lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat
 Before it all starts, they suffer through harm just to touch a dream
 Oh, pick yourself up 'cause

 Legends never die
 Legends never die
 Legends never die
 Legends never die

 When the world is callin' out your name, begging you to fight
 Pick yourself up once more
 Pick yourself up 'cause

 Legends never die
 Legends never die
 Legends never die
 Legends never die
 Legends never die
Tell me where do I go
Tell me where do I take us
Your heart is starting to slow
May the water be safer
As I dive in
Blood stains washing underneath the waves
As we fall as we fall
I'll be reaching out to keep your safe
As we fall as we fall
I can't hold on much longer
We drifting down to the other side
Tried to pull us under
Keep holding out for the other side




Tell me where do I go
Tell me where do I take us
Tell me where do I go
Tell me where do I take us
Your heart is starting to slow
May the water be safer
As I dive in
Tell me where do I go
Tell me where do I take us
Tell me where do I go
Tell me where do I take us
Your heart is starting to slow
May the water be safer
As we fall
I can't hold on much longer
We drifting down to the other side
Tried to pull us under
Keep holding out for the other side
