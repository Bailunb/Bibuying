Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothin' seems to fit
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'

So I just did me some talkin' to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleepin' on the job
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'

But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me won't defeat me
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Cryin's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
Because I'm free
Nothin's worryin' me

It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Cryin's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
Because I'm free
Nothin's worryin' me
Nothin's worryin' me
When you're down and troubled
And you need some loving care
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again

Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you Carole King
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again

Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend

When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
Oh, but don't you let them

You just call out my name Gloria Estefan
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea
You lay your bets and then you pay the price
The things we do for love, the things we do for love

Communication is the problem to the answer
You've got her number and your hand is on the phone
The weather's turned and all the lines are down
The things we do for love, the things we do for love

Like walking in the rain and the snow
when there's nowhere to go
When you're feeling like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up
Ooh you made me love you
Ooh you've got a way
Ooh you had me crawling on the floor

Like walking in the rain and the snow
when there's nowhere to go
When you're feeling like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up
Ooh you made me love you
Ooh you've got a way
Ooh you had me crawling on the floor

A compromise would surely help the situation
Agree to disagree but disagree to part
When after all it's just a compromise
Of the things we do for love
the things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
Now that I've lost everything to you
You say you wanna start something new
And it's breakin' my heart you're leavin'
Baby, I'm grievin'

But if you wanna leave, take good care
I hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there

Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child, girl

You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breaking my heart in two
'Cause I never wanna see you a sad girl
Don't be a bad girl
But if you wanna leave, take good care
I hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware

Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child, girl

Baby, I love you
But if you wanna leave, take good care
I hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware

Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child, girl
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child, girl
I'm sitting here in a boring room
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do
I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder

I'm driving around in my car
I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens, and I wonder

I wonder how, I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around
And all that I can see is just a yellow (another) lemon tree
La, la da dee da, etc.

I'm sitting here, I miss the power
I'd like to go out taking a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired, put myself into bed
Where nothing ever happens and I wonder

Isolation is not good for me
Isolation I don't want to sit on a lemon tree
I'm stepping around in a dessert of joy
Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
And everything will happen and you'll wonder

I wonder how, I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around
And all that I can see is just a yellow (another) lemon tree

I wonder how I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
And all that I can see
And all that I can see (dit dit dit)
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
沉默的嘴唇
还留着泪痕
这不是胭脂红粉
可掩饰的伤痕
破碎的心灵
流失了多少的情
弥补的谎言
偿还的借口
我不会去当真
爱的心路旅程
只能够你我两个人
不可能是我独徘徊
也不可能三人行
你可以去找新的恋情
也可以不留一点音讯
但不要用偿还作借口
再让我伤心
爱哭的眼睛
让泪水染红
要多少岁月时光
才遗忘这段情
脆弱的心情
还留着你的伤痕
弥补的谎言偿还的借口
我怎么能相信
爱的心路旅程
我曾经答应你牵引
这只能说我太多情
不敢埋怨你无情
我曾经耐心听你表明
也已经谅解你的苦衷
请不要用偿还作借口
伤了我自尊
爱的心路旅程
我曾经答应你牵引
这只能说我太多情
不敢埋怨你无情
我曾经耐心听你表明
也已经谅解你的苦衷
但不要用偿还作借口
伤了我自尊
今夜还吹着风 想起你好温柔
有你的日子分外的轻松
也不是无影踪 只是想你太浓
怎么会无时无刻 把你梦

爱的路上有你 我并不寂寞
你对我那么的好 这次真的不同
也许我应该好好 把你拥有
就像你一直为我 守候

亲爱的人 亲密的爱人
谢谢你这么长的时间 陪着我
亲爱的人 亲密的爱人
这是我一生中 最兴奋的时分

越过落地玻璃窗
我努力把眼光放向远方
隔着白色的烟雾
没有人说抱歉 也没有人哭

沉默怎么能说明一切
等待怎么能没有终结
未来怎么能不管从前
真心怎能说变就变

爱情怎么能容许介入
心酸怎么能说清楚
继续或结束 该由谁宣布

三个人的晚餐 没有人开口交谈
窗外星光斑斓 没有人觉得浪漫
三个人的晚餐 怎么吃也吃不完
因为我不知道 该如何互道晚安
该如何互道晚安 该如何互道晚安

等待着你 等待你慢慢的靠近我
陪着我长长的夜到尽头
别让我独自守候

等待着你 等待你默默凝望着我
告诉我你的未来属于我
除了我别无所求

你知道这一生 我只为你执着
管别人心怎么想 眼怎么看 话怎么说
你知道这一生 我只为你守候
我对你情那么深 意那么浓 爱那么多

等待着你 等待你轻轻拉我的手
陪着我长长的路慢慢走
一直到天长地久

等待着你 等待你紧紧拥抱着我
告诉我你的心里只有我
除了我别无选择

你知道这一生 我只为你执着
不管他喜还是悲 苦还是甜 对还是错
你知道这一生 我只为你守候
我对你情那么深 意那么浓 爱那么多

等待着你 等待你紧紧拥抱着我
告诉我你的心里只有我
永远爱我 等待着你
那南风吹来清凉

闻这夜来香
夜来香我为妳歌唱
夜来香我为妳思量
啊~啊我为妳歌唱
我为妳思量
夜来香

I see the crystal raindrops fall
And the beauty of it all
When the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind
When I think of you some time
I want to spend some time with you

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

We look for love, no time for tears
Wasted waters's all that is
It don't make no flowers grow
Good things might come to those who wait
Not for those who wait too late
We got to go for all we know

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

I hear the crystal raindrops fall
On the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew
Darling, when the morning comes
And I see the morning sun
I want to be the one with you

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building big castles way on high
Just the two of us
You and I

Just the two of us
Let's get together, baby
Just the two of us
We can make it
Just the two of us
We can make it
Just the two of us
You and I
Just the two of us
Let's get together, baby
玫瑰玫瑰我爱你
玫瑰玫瑰最娇美 玫瑰玫瑰最艳丽

常夏开在荆棘里 玫瑰玫瑰我爱你

心的誓约 心的情意 圣洁的光辉照大地
心的誓约 心的情意 圣洁的光辉照大地
玫瑰玫瑰枝儿细 玫瑰玫瑰刺儿锐
今朝风雨来摧残 伤了嫩枝和娇蕊

玫瑰玫瑰心儿坚 玫瑰玫瑰刺儿尖
来日风雨来摧毁 毁不了并蒂枝连理
玫瑰玫瑰我爱你
作词 GATES DAVID / 作曲 GATES DAVID

And Aubrey was her name

a not so very ordinary girl or name
But who's to blame

for a love that wouldn't bloom
for the hearts that never played in tune
Like a lovely melody that everyone can sing
take away the words that rhyme it doesn't mean a thing

And Aubrey was her name

We triped the light and danced togther to the moon

but where was June

No it never came around

If it did it never made a sound

maybe I was absent or was listening to fast

catching all the words but then the meaning going past

but god I miss the girl

and I'd go a thousand times around the world
just to be closer the her than to me

And Aubrey was her name

I never new her but I loved her just the same

I loved her name

Wish that I had found the way

and the reasons that would make her stay

I have learned to lead a life apart from all the rest

If I can't have the one I want I'll do without the best

But how I miss the girl

and I'd go a million times around the world
just to say she had been mine for a day
Good morning' yesterday
You wake up and time has slipped away
And suddenly it's hard to find
The memories you left behind
Remember' do you remember
The laughter and the tears

The shadows of misty yesteryears

The good times and the bad you've seen
And all the others in between
Remember' do you remember
The times of your life you

Reach back for the joy and the sorrow
Put them away in your mind
The mem'ries are time that you borrow

To spend when you get to tomorrow

Here comes the saddest part the saddest
The seasons are passing one by one

So gather moments while you may
Collect the dreams you dream today
Remember' will you remember
The times of your life

Gather moments while you may
Collect the dreams you dream today
Remember' will you remember

The times of your life

Of your life

Do you remember' baby
Do you remember the times of your life
Do you remember' baby
Do you remember the times of your life
starry, starry night
paint your palette blue and grey

look out on a summer's day
with eyes that know the darkness in my soul
shadows on the hills

sketch the trees and the daffodils
catch the breeze and the winter chills
in colors on the snowy linen land

now i understand what you tried to say to me

how you suffered for your sanity
how you tried to set them free
they would not listen, they did not know how
perhaps they'll listen now
starry, starry night

flaming flowers that brightly blaze
swirling clouds in violet haze
reflect in vincent's eyes of china blue
colors changing hue
morning field of amber grain
weathered faces lined in pain
are smoothed beneath the artist's loving hand
now i understand what you tried to say to me
how you suffered for your sanity

how you tried to set them free
they would not listen, they did not know how
perhaps they'll listen now
for they could not love you
but still your love was true
and when no hope was left in sight
on that starry, starry night
you took your life, as lovers often do
but i could have told you, vincent
this world was never meant for one
as beautiful as you
starry, starry night
portraits hung in empty halls
frameless head on nameless walls
with eyes that watch the world and can't forget
like the strangers that you've met

all the ragged men in the ragged clothes
the silver thorn of bloody rose
lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
now i think i know what you tried to say to me
how you suffered for your sanity
how you tried to set them free
they would not listen, they're not listening still
perhaps they never will
一种念头 在心中萌芽着
外面的雨 打在窗口

一直梦到 你说受够了我
我也不要 这样承受
或许说出去一会 就在也没回过头
心的闷和孤独 脚还继续走

或许某一天我会 去朝着冷空气走
有厚的云 和 灰的天空
一种念头 在心中萌芽着
外面的雨 打在窗口
一直梦到 你说受够了我
我也不要 这样承受
或许说出去一会 就在也没回过头
心的闷和孤独 脚还继续走

或许某一天我会 去朝着冷空气走
有厚的云 和 灰的天空
或许说出去一会 就在也没回过头
心的闷和孤独 脚还继续走
说不出我的感受 是伤心难过或寞落
或许只是怀念他的旧
the rustling leaves and the chilly midnight wind
i wonder if it's your car pulling into the driveway
baby do you know what it's like to wait

put on your shoes
people used to tell me
now they think it's like a style
of some kind or something
how do I explain that
I just don't believe in
all this purposely for
the world's perception of me
this is only rubbish put eloquently
like all the gothic poetry
kids are writing
form the high school scence hey
Let's start running
for no reason
Let's start laughing
without any jokes
when did we need excuses
to do what we do I won't explain myself

Wouldn't you agree that sounds nice
that's right
we can go out
wathch a movie
climb out my window
in the middle of the night
and when the world's asleep
we shall dance like mad amusement only
Wouldn't you agree that sounds nice

So you mean you just
don't like wearing shoes
I've got sweety feet
I think I've made my point
If you truly like it then
it won't mean a thing
if it's a trend or if it's banned
by the fashion police
all the things I do I don't do them for you
I'm not down to earth not
planning to be
it's all hypocrisy hey
Let's start running
for no reason
Let's start laughing
without any jokes
when did we need excuses
to do what we do I won't explain myself
Wouldn't you agree that sounds nice
that's right
we can go out
watch a movie
climb out my window
in the middle of the night
and when the world's asleep
we shall dance like mad amusement only
Wouldn't you agree that sound nice

that's right
we can go out
watch a movie
climb out my window
in the middle of the night
and when the world's asleep
we shall dance like mad amusement only
Wouldn't you agree that sound nice
Giving up why should I
we've come to far to forget
beautiful just got lost
somewhere along the way
so much was missing when you went away
Let's start from here lose the past
change our minds we don't need a finish line
let's take this chance don't think too deep
of all those promises we couldn't seem to keep
I don't care where we go
Let's start from here

standing here face to face
a finger on your lips
don't say a word don't make a sound
silence surrounds us now
even when you were gone I felt you everywhere
Let's start from here lose the past
change our minds we don't need a finish line
let's take this chance not think too deep
of all those promises we couldn't seem to keep
I don't care where we go
Let's start from here
Let's start from here
I've never been the one to open up
but you've always been the voive within
the only warmth from my cold heart
Let's start from here, lose the past
change our minds we don't need a finish line
let's take this chance don't think too deep
of all those promises
Let's start from here lose the past
change our minds
we don't need a finish line
let's take this chance don't think too deep
of all those promises we couldn't seem to keep
I don't care where we go
Let's start from here
Let's start from here
Let's start from here
Let's start from here
I know that it might sound strange
But you made my seasons start to change
It happened so suddenly
Like heaven has waited up for me
I've just been looking so long
Kept meeting my Mr.Wrong
In every model and every size
Now my fantasy
Is staring at your eyes
Sometimes you think I'm beautiful
But I don't know
I'll keep it to myself
You say it,It feels wonderful
My smile can show
I'm lost in paradise
The letters you wrote to me
Showed me the songs I've never seen
I thought every man I'd want
Falls out of a dating magazine
But I konw that with you
That was so far from the truth
On every page and evert line
Now you're my everything
I guess you know how to read my mind
Sometimes you think I'm beautiful
But I don't know
I'll keep it to myself
You say it,It feels wonderful
My smile can show
I'm lost in paradise
I know
I guess that it shows
The message that flows to me
Makes it more worth than make believe
Sometimes you think I'm beautiful
But I don't know
I'll keep it to myself
You say it,It feels wonderful
My smile can show
I'm lost in paradise
Sometimes you think I'm beautiful
But I don't know
I'll keep it to myself
You say it,It feels wonderful
My smile can show
I'm lost in paradise
Rain-drenched roads
Matching steps
and Let-down hair
And someone's laughter too

City nights
Oh
the city sighs

Then loneliness
Lingers in the air
ooh yeah

And so it's said that I left my heart
I left it in a lost Taipei with you
Neon signs and midnight rides
The curve of your smile kisses joy
The curve of your smile kisses joy
Flowers bllom when you play
Can I have your autograph or something like that
come on come on
Flowers bllom when you play
Oh don't be so stingy now I want it on my wall
come on come on
Mothers weep
Lovers meet
Don't make a sound
Close the door behind
oh yeah
Aimless souls
Oh
wondering feet
They won't go home
Waltz into the night ~~~

And so it's said that I left my heart
I left it in a lost Taipei with you
Neon signs and midnight rides
The curve of your smile kisses joy
The curve of your smile kisses joy
Flowers bllom when you play
Can I have your autograph or something like that
come on come on
Flowers bllom when you play
Oh don't be so stingy now I want it on my wall
come on come on

woo
come on come on
Flowers bllom when you play
Don't be so stingy now You know I want it bad
Yes you~know~that~
Um m m

I'll be raising cattle And then some sheep

Play the conga And then some sleep
woo

yeah
Play the conga And then some sleep
woo o o o`
作曲 : billy joel
Some folks to get away
Take a holiday from the neighborhood
Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood
But I'm talking Greyhound
On the Hudson River Line
I'm in a New York state of mind

I've seen all the movie stars
In their fancy cars and their limousines
Been high in the Rockies under the evergreens
But I know what I'm needin'
And I don't waste more time
I'm in a New York state of mind

It was so easy living day by day
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take
The New York Times the Daily News

It comes down to reality
And it's fine with me cause I've let it slide
I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
I don't have any reasons
I've left them all behind
I'm in a New York state of mind

It comes down to reality
And it's fine with me cause I've let it slide
I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
I don't have any reasons
I've left them all behind
I'm in a New York state of mind
Goodbye my love
I'm goanna miss you
When I go I promise to forget
I'd never twist a story sideways
I was traveled different highways
And it always leads me back to you again
We connected through the distance
With electric hearts somehow
Still dreaming bout tomorrow-oh oh
But all we have is now
Now now
All we have is now
The future's on illusion
Don't fall for empty vows
All we have is now
Staons on the paper
Are tears from yesterday
When the colors start to fade it's like it rained
My thoughts could fill an ocean
I'm drowing in emotion
And we'll never have this moment back again
Chain a light through all the bridges
That somehow kisses the sky
And the angels tart to cry
Cause all we have is now
All we have is now
The future's on illusion
Don't fall for empty vows
All we have is now
Sounds of silence cross our minds
It's not the record playing
We're closer
All we have is now
And in this one reality
Single words come suddenly
An accident of melody and harmany
All we have is now

Cause all we have is now
All we have is now
The future's on illusion
Don't fall for empty vows
All we have is now
Cause all we have is now
All we have is now
The future's on illusion
Don't fall for empty vows
All we have is now
One step too far
All at once I'm falling
Just like a star,I'm buring for you
Thought I could keep myself from feeling this way
I guess that was my first mistake
Cause suddenly I'm walking
Down a dark street to your door
Wanting you is driving me insane
And now my feet are standing
Where they've never stood before
Guided by a twist of fate
If I lose myself with you tonight
Fall apart or hold on tight
Wrong or right
I won't be afraid
Cause evev if my heart should break
You'd be the best mistake I ever made
I'm in your room
Now there's no denying
What's in your eyes
When I look at you
Tow shadows talking but they don't make a sound
Words have lost their meaning now
And the air has turned electric
Now I know the time is right
To put myself into your hands
And suddenly I'm shaking
As your fingers touch my skin
I don't need to understand
(but)If I lose myself with you tonight
Fall apart or hold on tight
Wrong or right
I won't be afraid
Cause evev if my heart should break
You'd be the best mistake I ever made
And if tomorrow proves me wrong
I swear I don't belong
I know I 'll carry on
So I will lose myself and brave my soul
Take this chance cause heaven knows
I'm so far gone my choice is made
And even if my heart should break
When I lose myself with you tonight
Fall apart or hold on tight
Wrong or right
I'll always say
You're the best mistake I ever made
You're the best mistake I ever made
You're the best mistake I ever made
作曲 : Gary Kemp
 作词 : Gary Kemp


So true funny how it seems
always in time but never in line for dreams
Head over heels when toe to toe
This is the sound of my soul
this is the sound

I bought a ticket to the world
but now I've come back again
why do I find it hard to write the next line
Oh I want the truth to be said

Huh huh huh huh huh huh
I know this much is true
Huh huh huh huh huh huh
I know this much is true

With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue
dissolve the nerves that I've just begun
Listening to Marvin（all night long）
This is the sound of my soul
this is the sound

Always slipping from my hands
Sets a time of its own
Take your seaside arms and write the next line
Oh I want the truth to be known

Huh huh huh huh huh huh
I know this much is true
Huh huh huh huh huh huh
I know this much is true


I bought a ticket to the world
but now I've come back again
Why do I find it hard to write the next line
Oh I want the truth to be said

Huh huh huh huh huh huh
I know this much is true
Huh huh huh huh huh huh
I know this much is true

uh this much is true
this much is true

Huh huh huh huh huh huh
uh this much is true
I know this much is true
看阳光在闪耀　看你的背影
你不过离开十五秒
回头看看我　你的微笑
我怦然心跳

因为　在我的心上　现在有了一个人
因为　在你身旁　我不再害怕　生命的空洞
现在　一切是那么美丽

因为你爱我　我不会再寂寞
忽然明白了　我们的相遇
是找到另一个自己
我忍受这孤寂　寻寻又觅觅
等待有一天　爱情的出现

穿越过人群　我并不在意
错过最后一班的捷运
慢慢走着　慢慢的想着
你的每一个神情

因为　在我的心上　现在有了一个人
因为　在你身旁　我不再害怕　生命的空洞
现在　一切那么美丽

因为你爱我　我不会再寂寞
忽然明白了　我们的相遇
是找到另一个自己
我忍受这孤寂　寻寻又觅觅
等待有一天　爱情的出现

爱我　我不会再寂寞
忽然明白了　我们的相遇
是找到另一个自己
我忍受这孤寂　寻寻又觅觅
等待有一天　爱情的出现

我不会再寂寞
忽然明白了　我们的相遇
是找到另一个自己
我忍受这孤寂　寻寻又觅觅
等待有一天　爱情的出现

wo...um...
我不会再寂寞
作曲 : lost in paradise
我怎么都不想睡
天特别的亮夜特别的黑
当我深深的呼吸
心中充满想你的甜蜜

想和你走在雨中
想要你牵我的手
傻傻的你不敢说爱
而我也故意要你为我等待

说不出有多么快乐
还是不够这感觉这一切
就好像飘在外太空
别的星球只有我们存在

喜欢和你在一起
无聊的生命也变有趣
让你听我的音乐
分享在每一刻的心情

在一起越来越久
开始会对你在乎
这感觉我们都明白
只要你在身边日子就亮起来

说不出有多么快乐
还是不够这感觉这一切
就好像飘在外太空
别的星球只有我们存在

爱情在这个时候
我的心就像天气
晴时多云偶尔有雨

说不出有多么快乐
还是不够这感觉这一切
就好像飘在外太空
别的星球只有我们存在

说不出有多么快乐
还是不够这感觉这一切
就好像飘在外太空
别的星球只有我们存在

Moon river wider than a mile

I'm crossing you in style someday

You dream maker, you heartbreaker

Wherever you're going I'm going your way

Two drifters off to see the world

There's such a lot of world to see

We're after the same rainbow's end

Waiting 'round the bend

My huckleberry friend, moon river and me

Two drifters off to see the world

There's such a lot of world to see

We're after the same rainbow's end

Waiting 'round the bend

My huckleberry friend, moon river and me

轻轻笑声再为我送温暖

伴着我绵绵密密思念

情挥不尽英雄身世飘无凭

归去依旧默默独行

声声问轻轻唤烟水柔情唤不醒

多少年多少心事坎坷

路 飘零路 茫茫烟雨遮不住
轻叹 江湖岁月无尽处

拥着你 匆匆往事数不尽

散不去 好梦难成愁酒易醒

忆往昔 几分心情暗低吟

当年情 在风中追忆已无影

拥着你 依稀彷彿在梦中

重相逢 不堪往事竟已无语

猛回首 几回风尘我独饮

当年情 化作泪眼烟云

声声问轻轻唤烟水柔情唤不醒

多少年多少心事坎坷

路 飘零路 茫茫烟雨遮不住

轻叹 江湖岁月无尽处

拥着你 匆匆往事说不尽

散不去 好梦难成愁酒易醒

忆往昔 几分心情暗低吟

当年情 在风中追忆已无影

拥着你 依稀彷彿在梦中

重相逢 不堪往事竟已无语

猛回首 几回风尘我独饮

当年情 化作泪眼烟云

南风吻脸轻轻 飘过来花香浓

南风吻脸轻轻 星已稀月迷蒙

我们紧偎亲亲 说不完情意浓

我们紧偎亲亲 句句话都由衷

不管明天 到明天要相送

恋着今宵 把今宵多珍重

我俩临别依依 怨太阳快升东
我俩临别依依 要再见在梦中

不管明天 到明天要相送

恋着今宵 把今宵多珍重

我俩临别依依 怨太阳快升东

我俩临别依依 要再见在梦中

是谁在敲打我窗

是谁在撩动琴弦

那一段被遗忘的时光

渐渐的回升出我心坎

是谁在敲打我窗

是谁在撩动琴弦

记忆中那欢乐的情景

慢慢地浮现在我的脑海

那缓缓飘落的小雨

不停地打在我窗

只有那沉默无语的我

不时地回想过去

是谁在敲打我窗

是谁在撩动琴弦

记忆中那欢乐的情景

慢慢地浮现在我的脑海
夜上海 夜上海

你是一个不夜城

华灯起 乐声响
歌舞升平

只见她 笑脸迎
谁知她内心苦闷
夜生活 都为了 衣食住行

酒不醉人 人自醉
胡天胡地
磋跎了青春

晓色朦胧 倦眼惺
大家归去
心灵儿随着
转动的车轮

换一换 新天地
别有一个新环境
回味着 夜生活
如梦初醒

换一换 新天地

别有一个新环境

回味着 夜生活
如梦初醒

渴望一个笑容

期待一阵春风

你就刚刚好经过

突然眼神交错
目光炽热闪烁
狂乱越难掌握

我像是着了魔
你欣然承受
别奢望闪躲

怕是谁的背影叫人难受

让我狠狠想你

让我笑你无情

连一场欲望都舍不得回避

让我狠狠想你

让这一刻暂停

都怪这花样年华太刺激

渴望一个笑容
期待一阵春风
你就刚刚好经过

突然眼神交错
目光炽热闪烁
狂乱越难掌握

我像是着了魔
你欣然承受
别奢望闪躲

怕是谁的背影叫人难受

让我狠狠想你

让我笑你无情

连一场欲望都舍不得回避

让我狠狠想你

让这一刻暂停

都怪这花样年华太美丽
让青春吹动了你的长发
让它牵引你的梦

不知不觉这城市的历史
已记取了你的笑容

红红心中蓝蓝的天
是个生命的开始

春雨不眠隔夜的你
曾空独眠的日子

让青春娇艳的花朵绽开了
深藏的红颜

飞去飞来的满天的飞絮
是幻想你的笑脸

秋来春去红尘中
谁在宿命里安排

冰雪不语寒夜的你
那难隐藏的光彩

看我看一眼吧
莫让红颜守空枕

青春无悔不死

永远的爱人

让流浪的足迹在荒漠里
写下永久的回忆

飘去飘来的笔迹是
深藏的激情你的心语

前尘后世轮回中
谁在声音里徘徊

痴情笑我凡俗的人世终难解的关怀

看我看一眼吧
莫让红颜守空枕

青春无悔不死

永远的爱人

让流浪的足迹在荒漠里
写下永久的回忆

飘去飘来的笔迹是
深藏的激情你的心语

前尘后世轮回中
谁在声音里徘徊

痴情笑我凡俗的人世
终难解的关怀

春雨不眠
隔夜的你曾空独眠的日子
如果没有遇见你
我将会是在哪里
日子过得怎么样
人生是否要珍惜
也许认识某一人
过着平凡的日子
不知道会不会
也有爱情甜如蜜
任时光匆匆流去
我只在乎你
心甘情愿感染你的气息
人生几何能够得到知己
失去生命的力量也不可惜
所以我求求你  别让我离开你
除了你，我不能感到 一丝丝情意
如果有那么一天
你说即将要离去
我会迷失我自己
走入无边人海里
不要什么诺言
只要天天在一起
我不能只依靠
片片回忆活下去
所以我求求你 别让我离开你
除了你 我不能感到 一丝丝情意
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
You've been out ridin' fences,
for so long - now.
Ohh you're a hard one.
I know that you've got your reasons.
These things that are pleasin'you
Can hurt you somehow.

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy
She'll beat you if she's able.
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet.
Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table.
But you only want the ones
That you can't get.

Desperado,
Ohhhh you aint getting no younger.
Your pain and your hunger,
They're driving you home.
And freedom, ohh freedom.
Well that's just some people talking.
Your prison is walking through this world all alone.

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine.
It's hard to tell the night time from the day.
And you're losing all your highs and lows
aint it funny how the feeling goes
away...

Desperado,
Why don't you come to your senses?
come down from your fences, open the gate.
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you.
You better let somebody love you.
(let sombody love you)
You better let somebody love you
before it's too late.

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
Blackbird fly blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird fly blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Yesterday,
All my troubles seemed so far away,
Now it looks as though they're here to stay,
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
I'm not half the man I used to be,
There's a shadow hanging over me,
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

Why he
Had to go I don't know, he wouldn't say.
I said,
Something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday,
Love was such an easy game to play,
Now I need a place to hide away,
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

If I could save time in a bottle

The first thing that I like to do

Is to save everyday till eternity passes away

Just to spend them with you

If I could make days last forever

If words could make wishes come true

I'd save everyday like a treasure

And then again I would spend them with you

But there never seem to be enough time
to do the things you want to do
Once you've found them

I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through the time with

If I had a box

just for wishes and dreams that had never come true

The box would be empty
Except for the memory of how they were answered by you

But there never seem to be enough time
to do the things you want to do
Once you've found them

I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to the go time through with
一个人孤单单的下午
当风吹得每棵树都想跳舞
记得昨天你穿蓝色衣服
你说对爱太专注容易孤独
这句话什么意思
我不清楚
我爱上了云
爱上你
多么希望像你
自由来去
原来星期天容易思念
反覆看部电影
一遍一遍
孤独的流着眼泪
回忆太美
爱多美丽
充满香气
只是在心里它总是酸溜溜地
我不懂我自己
越来越像lemon tree
我一天一天更爱你
我不管不管不管爱会苦苦地
海蓝蓝的天气
我的爱是lemon tree
我爱上了云
爱上你
多么希望像你
自由来去
原来星期天容易思念
反覆看部电影
一遍一遍
孤独的流着眼泪
回忆太美
isolation
想住进你心里
isolation
期待下雨的一棵lemon tree
你总是望着蓝蓝海面
说着流浪过的梦容易实现
这句话什么意思
我不清楚
爱多美丽
充满香气
只是在心里它总是酸溜溜地
我不懂我自己
越来越像lemon tree
我一天一天更爱你
我不管不管不管爱会苦苦地
海蓝蓝的天气
我的爱是lemon tree
我一天一天更爱你
我不管不管不管爱会苦苦地
海蓝蓝的天气

海蓝蓝的天气
我的爱是lemon tree

Crashed your bike
You scraped your knee

You need a lending hand to pull you free

Don't have a girlfriend
Neck is getting hairy

Sitting on the sidewalk and us you see

We are the friendly teenage girl patrol
Doing our best to help out the world
Yeah go on and call on us girl patrols
And we sing
Come on girls patrolling
On the sandy beach
We're sweating and helping
Out those in need
Sun shining

And we're helping all the needy

Better than a wet dream
Come on girls patrolling

On the sandy beach
We're sweating and helping
Out those in need
Sun shining

Good-good times

Good-good times

Many people saddened by
The current state of their lives

Oh no
Well a good time listen up is knowing life doesn't suck

Just look outside

Oh the sun keeps shining on my crinkled brows

I keep looking at the sky and then
Counting all them clouds I am
Oh the sun keeps shining on my crinkled brows

Automobiles keep whizzing by
Well I'm counting all them crows that fly

Good-good times

Good-good times

Good-good times

Good-good fucking time

Times when you're feeling blue

All you need is you and you and only you

To be feeling good

Life let it shine
It's just which angle that you choose to take
That makes everything so freaking great

Oh the sun keeps shining on my crinkled brows

I keep looking at the sky and then
Counting all them clouds I am
Oh the sun keeps shining on my crinkled brows

Automobiles keep whizzing by
Well I'm counting all them crows that fly
Good-good times

Good-good times

Good-good times

Good-good fucking time

Times when you're feeling blue

All you need is you and you and only you

To be feeling good

Life let it shine man

It's just which angle that you choose to take
That makes everything so freaking great

Like a birdie in the sky
Looking onward with your eyes
Don't look back
Keep flying high

So remember kids
All the things you learned today
It's all good it's all fine

It's the angle that you take this
Time that you're feelin' blue

All you need is you and you and only you

To be feelin' good

Life let it shine

It's just which angle that you choose to take
That makes everything so freakin' great

Maybe it is time old man

That you declared the rightful heir

To your property

It's all written out I just need your name on the dotted line

Oh won't you please

Maybe it is time old man

That you declared the rightful heir

To your property

It's all written out I just need your name on the dotted line

Oh won't you please

Fancy clothes and jewelry

Beyond my wildest dreams

While all that awaits me

I'd better have myself a think

What can I do to expedite this process you ask me

Well it takes not much to execute his final deed to me

A few drops in his drink or a needle in his sleep

Oh so many things to scheme

I must not forget to weep

迷宫一样的未来转一个圈
会到哪里我喜欢爱情有点神秘

陪着我喝咖啡爱在空气里
暖暖的是你的笑赶走心情的灰
我想我不在意你曾爱过谁

无所谓就算爱像空沙发在等待
拥抱着是不确定我喜欢爱情多点惊喜

I love you

you and me
I can only give my life
And show you all I am
In the breath I breathe
I will promise you my heart
And give you all you need
If it takes some time
If you tell me you don't need me anymore
That our love won't last forever
I will ask you for a chance to try again
To make our love a little better
I love you
Say we're together, baby
Say we're together, oh
I need you
I need you forever baby
You and me
Say you hardly know
Exactly who I am
So hard to understand
I knew right from the start
The way I felt inside
If you read my mind
If you tell me don't need me anymore
That our love won't last forever
I will ask you for a chance to try again
To make our love a little better
I love you
Say we're together, baby
Say we're together, oh

Remember when you used to hold me
Remember when you made me cry
You said you loved me
Oh you did

You and me
I know that it might sound strange
But you made my seasons start to change
It happened so suddenly
Like heaven has waited up for me
I've just been looking so long
Kept meeting my Mr.Wrong
In every model and every size
Now my fantasy
Is staring at your eyes
Sometimes you think I'm beautiful
But I don't know
I'll keep it to myself
You say it,It feels wonderful
My smile can show
I'm lost in paradise
The letters you wrote to me
Showed me the sogns I've never seen
I thought every man I'd want
Falls out of a dating magazine
But I know that with you
That was so far from the truth
On every page and evert line
Now you're my everything
I guess you know how to read my mind
Sometimes you think I'm beautiful
But I don't know
I'll keep it to myself
You say it,It feels wonderful
My smile can show
I'm lost in paradise
I know
I guess that it shows
The message that flows to me
Makes it more worth than make believe
Sometimes you think I'm beautiful
But I don't know
I'll keep it to myself
You say it,It feels wonderful
My smile can show
I'm lost in paradise
Sometimes you think I'm beautiful
But I don't know
I'll keep it to myself
You say it,It feels wonderful
My smile can show
I'm lost in paradise

搭上陌生的公车 把心放得空空的
所有喜怒哀乐都关掉重设
享受沿途的绿色 目的地不用预设
今天就活在即刻 烦恼都不需要记得
跨出安全地带 离开
才能够 邂逅那 美丽的 小意外
换上冒险的心态 很轻快 未来 无限精彩
我 就像那落叶 顺其自然随兴的飞
我不用理不用想不用管天南地北
或许我将会遇上谁 (或许我会忘了谁)
或许该给或许机会
不用活在别人的嘴 简单得很完美
随机的飞 随心的坠 进或退 是或非 都无所谓
只要感觉对 做甚么都对
I just wanna go my way
On a random day
随手打开收音机 聆听未知的新意
下首歌总有想不到的惊喜
走在忙碌的世纪 偶而慢活很刺激
大胆丢掉行事历 这一天就留给自己
跨出安全地带 离开
才能够 邂逅那 美丽的 小意外
换上冒险的心态 很轻快 未来 无限精彩
我 就像那落叶 顺其自然随兴的飞
我不用理不用想不用管天南地北
或许我将会遇上谁 (或许我会忘了谁)
或许该给或许机会
不用活在别人的嘴 简单得很完美
随机的飞 随心的坠 进或退 是或非 都无所谓
只要感觉对 做甚么都对
I just wanna go my way
On a random day
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Anything can happen on a random day
At a point in the universe
Anything can happen on a random day
At a point in the universe
Anything can happen
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you
You feel like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
As long as love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know if it's real
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you


I love you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby
To warm a lonely night
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say

Oh pretty baby
Don't bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found you this day
And let me love you baby
Let me love you

You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you
You feel like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
As long as love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you


I love you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby
To warm a lonely night
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say

Oh pretty baby
Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found you this day
Oh pretty baby
Trust in me when i say （it's） ok

I love you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby
To warm a lonely night
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say

Oh pretty baby
Don't bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found you this day
And let me love you baby
Let me love you
