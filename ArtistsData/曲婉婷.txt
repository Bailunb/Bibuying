Do you know the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you say “I'd love to”
It makes me feel alive
Do you know the way you run your fingers through my hair
And I'm with you now

Life is like a…
Life is like a song
Sing along
On and on and on it lingers on
Come along
Piece together phrases in a funny way
Life is like a song

It was a rainy day
I got you on the phone
How do you do?
It's been a while or two
A while or two
Suddenly the clouds had disappeared
Love is kind, love is blind
I don't mind being your lover's fool

Life is like a…
Life is like a song
Sing along
On and on and on it lingers on
Come along
Piece together phrases in a funny way Hey
Life is like a song

Oh... Life is like a song
Life is like a song
It has its ups and downs
Life is like a song
And it carries us on, oh…
It is like a song...

On and on and on...
Life is like a song
It has its ups and downs
And it carries us on, oh…
Life is like a…
Life is like a…
Life is like a…
Life is like a…
A... Song

Another sunrise, another sunset
Soon it'll all be yesterday
Another good day, another bad day,
What did you do today?
Why do we choose to chase what we'll lose?
What you want isn't what you have.
What you have may not be yours, to keep.
If I could find love, at a stop, in a park with open arms,
I would save all my love, in a jar,
made of sparks, sealed in my beating heart,
Could it be yours to keep, the Jar of Love.
Another left turn, another head turns
Could he be someone I deserve?
Another right turn, another lesson learned
Never leave an open flame to burn
Why do we choose to chase what we'll lose?
What you want isn't what you have.
What you have may not be yours, to keep.
If I could find love,
at a stop, in a park with open arms,
I would save all my love,
in a jar,made of sparks,
sealed in my beating heart,
Could it be yours to keep, the Jar of Love.
Could you be my love
Could you be my love
Could you be my love
Could you be my love
Could you be her love
Could you be his love
Could you be my love
Could I be you love
If I could find love,
at a stop, in a park with open arms,
I would save all my love,
in a jar,made of sparks,
sealed in my beating heart,
Could it be yours to keep
If I could find love,

the Jar of Love.
Could it be yours to keep
the Jar of Love.

How many times you asked yourself before
What’s the point
wasting time
But how many times you stand up for yourself
Make a point
you have a reason
You know
it’s not fair
Your life
belongs to nobody else
So don’t tell me there is nobody you want to hold
You know you messed up but nobody can live alone
So don’t tell me there is nothing left in this world
Just open your eyes
you got everything in the world
How many times you want to give up yourself
Once again
there’s no point
But how many times you kept on moving on
Once again
you have a reason
You know
it’s not fair
Your life
belongs to nobody else
So don’t tell me there is nobody you want to hold
You know you messed up but nobody can live alone
So don’t tell me there is nothing left in this world
Just open your eyes
you got everything in the world
Does it make you wonder?
Is it karma or is it fate
Is it you
or is it me
Oh does it really make you falter
Does it make you want to believe?
It is true
you’re like nobody else
So don’t tell me there is nobody you want to hold
You know you messed up but nobody can live alone
So don’t tell me there is nothing left in this world
Just open your eyes
you got everything in the world
Just open your eyes
you got everything in the world
I open my eyes
I have you in my world

你总是一副不在意的样子
在我面前笑嘻嘻
话语如儿戏我对你充满疑意
然而当他的手挥舞在我的肩臂
突然你的眉间多了一丝严厉
而在你眼里找到的却是怜惜
你转过身去拳已攥紧
你承认吧你需要我
可你需要更多的是勇气
你害怕失去更害怕一个人的孤寂
我承认了我需要你
选择友谊是对爱情的逃避
试着抛开怀疑
因为我已经无力再抗拒
我总是猜不透你的用意
曾经试图一而再再而三读懂你
如果说我不在意
那也是一出戏这不是秘密
在你面前我无须掩盖什么东西
因为你懂我的点点滴滴
我只是来不及承认自己
你承认吧你需要我
可你需要更多的是勇气
你害怕失去更害怕一个人的孤寂
我承认了我需要你
选择友谊是对爱情的逃避
试着抛开怀疑
因为我已经无力再抗拒
看不清弄不明
我不想再猜测什么
只要听你说我需要你
你承认吧你需要我
可你需要更多的是勇气
你害怕失去更害怕一个人的孤寂
我承认了我需要你
选择友谊是对爱情的逃避
试着抛开怀疑
因为我已经无力再抗拒
你承认吧你需要我
可你需要更多的是勇气
你害怕失去更害怕一个人的孤寂
我承认了我需要你
选择友谊是对爱情的逃避
试着抛开怀疑

 当 你的眼 凝望我的眼
 世界从此不再需要语言
 当 你的唇 迎接我的吻
 世界从此不再需要时间
 有爱在 围绕我心间

 有你在 苦也是甜

 有多少个昨天
 是为了能圈住今天的一个愿
 有多少次迷路
 是为了能停留在这一瞬间
 因为有你所以有今天

 当 你的手 徘徊我指间
 世界从此少了一份孤单
 当你说你这一生只是为
 了每天多爱我一点点
 世界从此多了一张笑脸
 有爱在 围绕我心间

 有你在 苦也是甜
 有多少个昨天
 是为了能圈住今天的一个愿
 有多少次迷路
 是为了能停留在这一瞬间
 因为有你所以有今天

 曾经流过的汗水
 茫然时的泪水
 今天已得到安慰
 曾经无助的疲惫
 今天已化成灰
 让我们牵手去面对
 有多少个昨天
 是为了能圈住今天的一个愿
 有多少次迷路
 是为了能停留在这一瞬间
 有多少个昨天
 是为了能圈住今天的一个愿
 有多少次迷路
 是为了能停留在这一瞬间
 因为有你所以有今天

没有一点点防备
也没有一丝顾虑
你就这样出现在我的世界里
带给我惊喜 情不自已

可是你偏又这样
在我不知不觉中 悄悄的消失
从我的世界里 没有音讯
剩下的只是回忆
你存在 我深深的脑海里
我的梦里 我的心里 我的歌声里

你存在 我深深的脑海里
我的梦里 我的心里 我的歌声里

还记得我们曾经
肩并肩一起走过 那段繁华巷口
尽管你我是陌生人 是过路人
但彼此还是感觉到了对方的
一个眼神 一个心跳
一种意想不到的快乐
好像是一场梦境 命中注定
你存在 我深深的脑海里
我的梦里 我的心里 我的歌声里
你存在 我深深的脑海里
我的梦里 我的心里 我的歌声里
世界之大为何我们相遇

难道是缘分 难道是天意

你存在 我深深的脑海里
我的梦里 我的心里 我的歌声里
你存在 我深深的脑海里
我的梦里 我的心里 我的歌声里

你存在 我深深的脑海里
我的梦里 我的心里 我的歌声里

又是你的面孔 带给我是笑容
在我哭泣的时候
又是你的问候 带给我是感动
在我孤寂的时候
虽然没有天生一样的
但在地球上我们是一样的
尽管痛的苦的没说的
但哪有一路走来都是顺风的
因为我们没有什么不同
天黑时我们仰望同一片星空
没有追求和付出哪来的成功
谁说我们一定要走别人的路
谁说辉煌背后没有痛苦
只要为了梦想不服输
再苦也不停止脚步

每一天 每一年 都可以是新的起跑线
也可以是终点 看你怎么选
望着无边无际遥远的地平线
哪里会是你的极限
我们没有什么不同
天黑时我们仰望同一片星空
没有追求和付出哪来的成功

天黑时我们仰望同一片星空

你准备好了吗

看街头 那对情侣

是那样的甜蜜 无忧无虑

情不自禁地走过去 拍拍她怀中的你

你望着我 我问你：

“你真的准备好了吗？这不是一时的笑话。

如果你不在乎她，请你放下。”

看不清是非真相睁一只眼闭一只眼的让他去吧，
你有个好女孩 天真的等你回家

你准备好了吗？

看窗外 那对情侣

是那样的熟悉 似曾相识

突然之间她转过身 不知不觉得已在哭泣

她需要你的时候 你在哪里？

“你真的准备好了吗？这不是一时的笑话。
如果你不在乎她，请你放下。”
看不清是非真相睁一只眼闭一只眼的让他去吧

你有个好女孩 天真的等你回家

你准备好了吗？

你准备好了 准备好了吗？

“你真的准备好了吗？一生一世的为他而牵挂?”
“你真的准备好了吗？接受伤害两人的代价?”

“你真的准备好了吗？一生一世的为他而牵挂。
你一定是很在乎他，从此装傻。”

可能是我经历太多，看的太多，听到的太多
我不想做那个女孩在痛苦中挣扎

“你真的准备好了吗？一生一世的为他而牵挂。
你一定是很在乎他，从此装傻。”

可能是我经历太多，看的太多，听到的太多

我不想做那个女孩在痛苦中挣扎

你准备好了吗？

身在他乡 志在远方
你的爱让我坚强
歌声荡漾 你为我鼓掌
沉浸在爱的海洋

从 不敢想到 想去做到
做到我想的
事实证明我并不像他们想象的那样脆弱
我只是需要一盏灯
一架钢琴 一支麦克风
身在他乡 志在远方
你的爱让我坚强
歌声荡漾 你为我鼓掌
沉浸在爱的海洋

曾经想象过做一名医生救死扶伤
也曾想象过做律师 做记者
做奥运冠军 但是都没有结果
因为我最想要的是一盏灯
一架钢琴 一支麦克风

身在他乡 志在远方
你的爱让我坚强
歌声荡漾 你为我鼓掌
沉浸在爱的海洋

身在他乡 志在远方
你的爱让我坚强

阳光下的我们穿着布鞋
戴耳机随节奏大步向前
牛仔裤仿佛是在对我们说：“你别太在乎！”

可又是谁夺走了我们最初的
善良友爱彼此信任尊重
我不要你的嘲讽冷漠刻薄
我要你的温度

我有我的态度
但也绝不失去我的风度

别告诉我 你不心痛
在每个带刺的字的背后
有一个孤单的脆弱的迷茫的灵魂
在向世人呐喊着“你有没有听到我？”

Clap your hands and say yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Clap your hands and say yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Clap your hands and say yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Ba ba la ba la ba…

阳光下的我喝着矿泉水
品着大自然给我的滋味
生活可以简单有时孤单
一个人也要快乐

我有我的态度
但也绝不失去我的风度

别告诉我 你不心痛

有一个孤单的脆弱的迷茫的灵魂
在向世人呐喊着“你有没有听到我？！”

也许命中注定我要来到你身旁
画你的模样 听你的胸膛
也许明天不会像今天一样辉煌
谁又不受伤在痛苦中成长
时间永远不会停留在这个寂寞的晚上
夜深人静的时候写首歌给自己唱
这样就不会感觉到没有你在我的身旁
爱是一种信仰 带给我力量
我愿为你而歌唱
也许思念不过只是对昨天的向往
当一个人在远方 它带来的更多是希望
也许我并不会将伤心写在脸上
因为我的梦 梦里有你的光亮
时间永远不会停留在这个寂寞的晚上
夜深人静的时候写首歌给自己唱
这样就不会感觉到没有你在我的身旁
爱是一种信仰 带给我力量
我愿为你而歌唱
带走你的忧伤…
不是不难过 放弃曾想过
这么努力为什么
今天看穿了 唱着这支歌
因为我爱你 别无选择
夜深人静的时候写首歌给自己唱
这样就不会感觉到没有你在我的身旁
爱是一种信仰 带给我力量
我愿为你而歌唱
带走你的忧伤

I don't want to fall asleep tonight

Cos I fear the world I wake up to
Is one without you

Every time I close my eyes

I don't wanna dream if dreaming is without you

Don't let it die, don't let it go

Don't wanna face the world alone

I can't make it on my own
I'll wait for you, it brings me hope

I know that you'll be coming home

Til that day, I'll sing for you

I long for your touch

I long for our crazy conversations

You make it easy to be wild and free

I try to make terms with time
“Can we all just stay like this
and let's not go anywhere?”

Don't let it die, don't let it go

Don't wanna face the world alone

I can't make it on my own
I'll wait for you, it brings me hope

I know that you'll be coming home

Til that day, I'll sing for you

I'll think of you

I'll learn from you

I'll send my love, to follow you

I just can't hide from you

I can't run  from you

I wanna start with you

I'm in love with you…
Don't let it die, don't let it  go

Don't wanna face the world alone

I can't make it on my own
I'll wait for you, it brings me hope
I know that you'll be coming home

Till that day, I'll sing for you

Don't let it die, don't let it go

Don't wanna face the world alone

I can't make it on my own
I'll wait for you, it brings me hope

I know that you'll be coming home
Til that day, I'll sing for you

Til that day, I'll sing for you

I'm going back to the sunset strip
A place I fell in love with a man
I know I had to see him again
So I drove a thousand miles in a day
Fourteen hours seemed like a piece of cake
Cause I know in the end the price was worth the fight
There he was, standing with his puzzled eyes
Then he closed the gaps between us, lips inches away
Suddenly love struck me down
My knees hit the ground
He loved me back
Like it was yesterday oh…
Love struck me down
I weep but no sound
A long awaited love struck me down
It's been three years since you left town
How've you been I hope life didn't bring you down
You must have met someone like me by now
Sunday morning I was in bed
Let the phone ring but it wouldn't end
I was mad, I picked up, it was you
“Hey you, I am back for good now…”
Then it brought me back to that day
your lips inches away
Suddenly love struck me down
My knees hit the ground
He loved me back
Like it was yesterday oh…
Love struck me down
I weep but no sound
A long awaited love struck me down
Just ask me to stay. I'll stay for the night
There's nowhere else I rather be than
here with your body next to mine
Holding me tight…
Back into your arms
love struck me down
My knees hit the ground
He loved me back
Like it was yesterday oh…
Love struck me down
I weep but no sound
A long awaited love struck me down
A long awaited love struck me down
A long awaited love struck me down
Come sit with me
My little friend
Help me understand
Why do they always
want me to be
 what I can’t become
 I try to make sense of it all
 I know i can I know i can
 I try to jump and catch that ball
 Even if I fall Even if I fall
 Every time I feelling down
 I can hear you say
 Nothing is everything going to waste
 Don’t throw it away
 Don’t throw it away
 Every time I feelling small
 About to hit a wall
 I look into your eyes suddenly I’m ok
 I can count on you
 I can count on you
 I‘ll stand by you
 My little friend
 Help you walk again
 I’ll give you a push
 And be there for you
 Like you were there for me
 I try my best not to disappoint
 You know I’m better than that
 Yeah I‘m better than that
 And if the world turned their back on me
 I know you’ll be right here next to me
 Every time I'm feeling down
 I can hear you say
 Nothing is everything going to waste
 Don’t throw it away Don’t throw it away
 Every time I feelling small
 About to hit a wall
 I look into your eyes suddenly I’m ok
 I can count on you
 I can count on you
 I am sorry
 Sometimes when I’m in my own world
 Oh I can be so cool
 But you’ve always believed in me
 Every time I felling down
 I can hear you say
 Nothing is everything going to waste
 Don’t throw it away Don’t throw it away
 Every time I feelling small
 About to hit a wall
 I look into your eyes suddenly I’m ok
 I can count on you
 I can count on you
 Every time I feelling down

 Nothing is everything going to waste

Life is a struggle, I'm not the only one

Love is a tangle and I'm not the only one

Everyone grows old and I'm not the only one

Then why the hell am I still feeling so alone?

Once again, I'm at a crossroads

Wondering which way I should go

If I go, will it take me home?

In my heart, I know…

Life is a struggle, I'm not the only one

Love is a tangle and I'm not the only one

Everyone grows old. I'm not the only one

Then why the hell am I still feeling so alone?

Once again, I'm hanging by a thread

Wondering if I should have my eyes closed

Before I cut my safety rope

In my heart, I know…

Life is a struggle, I'm not the only one

Love is a tangle and I'm not the only one

Everyone grows old and I'm not the only one…

Then why the hell am I still feeling so…
How am I still feeling so…
Why the hell am I still feeling so…alone?

Life is a struggle, I'm not the only one

Love is a tangle. I'm not the only one

Everybody wants to have someone to hold

Then why the hell am I still feeling so…
How am I still feeling so…
Why the hell am I still feeling so…alone?

Life is a struggle…

Love is a tangle…

Everyone grows old and I'm not the only one

Then why the hell am I still… alone

人生是否要珍惜

也许认识某一人

不知道会不会

 Wont you come and sweep me off my feet
 Catch me when I fall
 Whisper,Whisper,
 Whisper these words in my ears tonight,
 I could fly away with you oh...

 When the darkness is falling
 When the night has come
 Baby will you hold my hand?
 When the sky is crying
 When this road is near the end
 Baby I will hold your hand

 Sweetheart,Sweetheart
 Mark my words and cross my heart
 Ill wait for you till the end
 What it is,What it is
 Its a kiss from my lips sealed on yours,
 and today Iii stay with you oh...

 When the darkness is falling
 When the night has come
 Baby will you hold my hand?
 When the sky is crying
 When this road is near the end
 Baby I will hold your hand

 When the storm is twisting left and right
 When you cant fall asleep at night
 Baby I will hold your hand
 Until the night is morning
 Until the seas apart...
 I wont let go of your hand

春天, 情不自禁想念
会到哪一天, 不再会去留恋
夏天, 天上掉着雨点
我不再是从前, 不会因你哭得红了眼
秋天, 花儿谢了一片
我不再会因你而改变
也不再会犹豫说再见
冬天, 很快又是一年
世界不是这个屋檐
没有你的日子更加甜
我感谢你离开了我, 你可知道
没有你我不会这么快的学到
什么是坚强,什么是真爱
人为何要先懂得爱自己再去爱别人
你以为你离开了, 我不会快乐
像电视里的女主角一样难过
我告诉你今天
我过得很快活…

“你走的那天 我哭了
不知道什么时候 能够停止这种感觉
一年以后的今天 我笑了
感谢你当初离开了我
没有了你的日子 我过得更快活”
每一天, 我都可以实现
所谓的事你曾说我做不到
我终于明白什么事都不依靠…
我感谢你离开了我, 你可知道
没有你我不会这么快的学到
什么是坚强,什么是真爱
人为何要先懂得爱自己再去爱别人
你以为你离开了, 我不会快乐

When minutes become hours
When days become years
And I don’t know where you are
Color seems so dull without you
Have we lost our minds?
What have we done?
But it all doesn’t seem to matter anymore
When you kissed me on that street, I kissed you back
You held me in your arms, I held you in mine
You picked me up to lay me down
When I look into your eyes
I can hear you cry for a little bit more of you and I
I’m drenched in your love
I’m no longer able to hold it back
Is it too late to ask for love?
Is it wrong to feel right?
When the world is winding down
Thoughts of you linger around
Have we lost our minds?
What have we done?
But it all doesn’t seem to matter anymore~~
When you kissed me on that street, I kissed you back
You held me in your arms, I held you in mine
You picked me up to lay me down
When I look into your eyes
I can hear you cry for a little bit more of you and I
I’m drenched in your love
I’m no longer able to hold it back~~~
When you kissed me on that street, I kissed you back
You held me in your arms, I held you in mine
You picked me up to lay me down
When I look into your eyes
I can hear you cry for a little bit more of you and I
I’m drenched in your love
I’m no longer able to hold it back
你总是一副不在意的样子
在我面前笑嘻嘻
话语如儿戏 我对你充满疑意
然而当他的手挥舞在我的肩臂
突然你的眉间多了一丝严厉
而在你眼里找到的却是怜惜
你转过身去 拳已攥紧

你承认吧 你需要我
可你需要更多的是勇气
你害怕失去更害怕一个人的孤寂
我承认了 我需要你
选择友谊是对爱情的逃避
试着抛开怀疑
因为我已经无力再抗拒

我总是猜不透你的用意
曾经试图一而再 再而三读懂你
如果说我不在意
那也是一出戏 这不是秘密
在你面前我无须掩盖什么东西
因为你懂我的点点滴滴
我只是来不及 承认自己

你承认吧 你需要我
可你需要更多的是勇气
你害怕失去更害怕一个人的孤寂
我承认了 我需要你
选择友谊是对爱情的逃避
试着抛开怀疑
因为我已经无力再抗拒

看不清 弄不明
我不想再猜测什么
只要听你说 我需要你

你承认吧 你需要我
可你需要更多的是勇气
你害怕失去更害怕一个人的孤寂
我承认了 我需要你
选择友谊是对爱情的逃避
试着抛开怀疑
因为我已经无力再抗拒
你承认吧 你需要我
可你需要更多的是勇气
你害怕失去更害怕一个人的孤寂
我承认了 我需要你
选择友谊是对爱情的逃避
试着抛开怀疑
因为我已经无力再抗拒

还记得那天下着雨	我遇见了你

你的眼神都让我	无处可躲

直到我们say	goodbye	我终于明白

你的气息已然足够把我灌醉

想你	每一分一秒都想着你

我知道见你不容易

梦里	梦里梦到的都是你

何时我才能见到你

今天的天气非常好，我起得很早

虽然眼睛睁不开	也不好不坏

等了你一整天电话	你却没有打

直到我再次问你	你说我很傻

听吧	这就是我的真心话

不管你怎样的回答

爱吧	就算苦我也不害怕

就让我最后一次傻

听吧	这就是我的真心话

不管你怎样的回答

爱吧	就算苦我也不害怕

就让我最后一次傻
就让我最后一次傻

How many times you asked yourself before
What’s the point' wasting time
But how many times you stand up for yourself

Make a point' you have a reason

You know' it’s not fair

Your life' belongs to nobody else
So don’t tell me there is nobody you want to hold

You know you messed up but nobody can live alone

So don’t tell me there is nothing left in this world

Just open your eyes; you got everything in the world

How many times you want to give up yourself

Once again' there’s no point
But how many times you kept on moving on

Once again' you have a reason

You know' it’s not fair

Your life' belongs to nobody else
So don’t tell me there is nobody you want to hold

You know you messed up but nobody can live alone

So don’t tell me there is nothing left in this world

Just open your eyes; you got everything in the world

Does it make you wonder?
Is it karma or is it fate
Is it you' or is it me

Oh does it really make you falter
Does it make you want to believe?

It is true' you’re like nobody else

So don’t tell me there is nobody you want to hold

You know you messed up but nobody can live alone

So don’t tell me there is nothing left in this world

Just open your eyes; you got everything in the world

Just open your eyes; you got everything in the world

I open my eyes; I have you in my world .

Thoughts are running through my head
Reluctance to failure, I refuse to cry
The outside showers the opening wound
I trip and fall until
Redundancy catches me up
I have no where to go
While she feeds me I hate myself, tears coming down I choke
The hour fills with wish and hope but the hour is gone
I threw myself, then I became a shell

Truth is, is not what you see
You see what you want to believe
There’s so much more to offer inside of me But I can’t come out
Because
Redundancy catches me up
I have no where to go
While she feeds me I hate myself, tears coming down I choke
The hour fills with wish and hope but the hour is gone
I threw myself, then I became a shell

Became a shell, became a shell, became a shell…
The outside, showers the opening wound
I trip and fall...
Redundancy catches me up, I have no where to go
While she feeds me I hate myself, tears coming down I choke
The hour fills with wish and hope but the hour is gone
I threw myself, and I became a shell

朝着 日落大道奔去
久别重逢是否可能
把破碎的爱 再还原
原来 爱不害怕路途遥远
也~不怕时光流逝人事非
怕只怕 爱得不够坚决
还 记得 拥抱时的心跳
还记得与你的亲吻
和你身上 的味道
让一切无处可逃
我学 会祈祷 忘掉 悲伤
爱的勇气再燃烧
哦哦哦 爱的勇气
我已准备好
再次迎接爱的来到
我们都不再年少
看懂似是而非的矫情
选择面对自己的 初心
不再回忆来路的艰辛
只当作必须付出的学习
放下了 面对着爱情
还 记得 拥抱时的心跳
还记得与你的 亲吻
和你身上 的味道
让一切无处可逃
我学~会祈祷 忘掉 悲伤
爱的勇气再燃烧

It is your birthday today
I got a flower for you
And dropped it off at your home
But you are not home today
It is a bad day today
You want to break up with me
You don't love me anymore
You write me off your list
Alright  alright
But I don't know why
Goodbye  goodbye
Have a good night don't cry
Goodbye goodbye
Good night good night
Say good bye to you
Good night to me
Goodbye goodbye
Good night good night
Say good night to you
Have a sweet dream tonight
Sometimes when I come to think
Of what I have done
At that moment I realized
No one is wrong or right
I wish you were here by my side
I could be everything you need
I dream the same dream of you
Everyday and every-night
Alright  alright
But I don't know why
Goodbye  goodbye
Have a good night don't cry
Goodbye goodbye
Good night good night
Say good bye to you
Good night to me
Goodbye goodbye
Good night good night
Say good nite to you
Have a sweet dream tonight
Goodbye goodbye
Good night good night
Say good bye to you
Good night to me
Goodbye goodbye
Good night good night
Say good night to you
Have a sweet dream tonight
One day, if someone wakes me up

Please don't tell me the truth
that we had the same story before
Someday, if I'm still in this world,
please crush me in your arms
Cause I fear I'm going to die

I thought I am strong
it's hard to say what would be wrong

Too far from what we've believed

I thought I am strong
when you held me for so long
And now my voice is gone
One day, you came into my dream
Sat next to me and said you wanted to be free
I said one day, you will be free

Just know that you are strong
Don't be gone for too long, if you do
Just follow my voice in this song
You'll come around

One day, if someone wakes me up
Please don't tell me the truth
that we had the same story before

One day, you broke my heart,

You took my dream and stole my soul,
you left me alone with nothing to say
I thought I am strong
it's hard to say what would be wrong

Too far from what we've believed
I thought I am strong
when you held me for so long
And now my voice is gone
One day, you came into my dream
Sat next to me and said you wanted to be free
I said one day, you will be free

Just know that you are strong
Don't be gone for too long, if you do
Just follow my voice in this song
You'll come around

One day, you came into my dream
Sat next to me and said you wanted to be free
I said one day, you will be free

Just know that you are strong
Don't be gone for too long, if you do
Just follow my voice in this song
You'll come around

You'll come around

等一回啊

我无悔啊
是谁在耳边
说
爱我永不变
只为这一句
啊哈断肠也无怨
雨心碎风流泪
梦缠绵情悠远

西湖的水
我的泪
我情愿和你化作一团火焰

等一回啊
千年等一回
我无悔啊
是谁在耳边
说
爱我永不变

You are my sunshine on a rainy day
You are the beat in my heart the rhythm in my guitar
And when we lock eyes
Oh baby I know, just what you're thinking is exactly what I'm thinking too
Oh they don't know what I know
They don't see what I see in you
We wanna be funny and silly
We'll set this no fun city free
You can be who you are and that's all good with me
Take off your suit and your crown
You're just a man in love
You're just a man in love with me
I'll say your beautiful yeah you're beautiful
I don't care if this word's never used on a man before
You got that magic to make my world stop
Then you got the power to make it all start again
Oh they don't know what I know
They don't see what I see in you
We wanna be funny and silly
We'll set this no fun city free
You can be who you are and that's all good with me
Take off your suit and your crown
You're just a man in love
You're just a man in love with me
Shoulder to shoulder
Arm in arm side by side
Together we walk as one
And you got that smile warms me up inside and out
Oh they don't know what I know
They don't see what I see in you
We wanna be funny and silly
We'll set this no fun city free
I can be who I am and that's alright with you
Take off my face and let down my hair
I'm just a girl in love
I'm just a girl in love with you
We wanna be funny and silly
We'll set this no fun city free
You can be who you are and that's all good with me
Take off your suit and your crown
You're just a man in love
You're just a man in love with me
I'm just a girl in love with you
We're just love birds flying free
We're just love birds flying free

我不能悲伤的睡在你身旁
尿不湿被你扔了
我也没有说我用不上那玩意儿
我需要它去骗某个人
在昨天
我不能悲伤的睡在你身旁
我不能悲伤的睡在你身旁
当我掀开那床被
想看看湖波山川的状景
那没有他们说的自古以来
然而我
又不能悲伤的睡在你身旁
我不能悲伤的睡在你身旁
music
那把吉他你拿回来了
你也没有说我用不上那玩意儿
我需要它来歌唱
在今天
我不能悲伤的睡在你身旁
我不能悲伤的睡在你身旁
在我走出那扇门
撕下某本书的二百五十二页
它用黑色镶金这般地写着:
hey
我不能悲伤的睡在你身旁
我不能悲伤的睡在你身旁
我不能悲伤的睡在你身旁
我不能悲伤的睡在你身旁
我不能悲伤的睡在你身旁
我不能悲伤的睡在你身旁
我不能悲伤的睡在你身旁...
Jar Of Love



Another sunrise, another sunset
Soon it'll all be yesterday
Another good day, another bad day,
What did you do today?
Why do we choose to chase what we'll lose?
What you want isn't what you have.
What you have may not be yours, to keep.
If I could find love, at a stop, in a park with open arms,
I would save all my love, in a jar,
made of sparks, sealed in my beating heart,
Could it be yours to keep, the Jar of Love.
Another left turn, another head turns
Could he be someone I deserve?
Another right turn, another lesson learned
Never leave an open flame to burn
Why do we choose to chase what we'll lose?
What you want isn't what you have.
What you have may not be yours, to keep.
If I could find love,
at a stop, in a park with open arms,
I would save all my love,
in a jar,made of sparks,
sealed in my beating heart,
Could it be yours to keep, the Jar of Love.
Could you be my love
Could you be my love
Could you be my love
Could you be my love
Could you be her love
Could you be he love
Could you be my love
Could I be you love
If I could find love,
at a stop, in a park with open arms,
I would save all my love,
in a jar,made of sparks,
sealed in my beating heart,
Could it be yours to keep
If I could find love,
at a stop, in a park with open arms,
I would save all my love,
in a jar,made of sparks,
sealed in my beating heart,
Could it be yours to keep
If I could find love,
at a stop, in a park with open arms,
I would save all my love,
in a jar,made of sparks,
sealed in my beating heart,
Could it be yours to keep
the Jar of Love.
Could it be yours to keep
the Jar of Love.
Could it be yours to keep
the Jar of Love.

没有一点点防备
也没有一丝顾虑
你就这样出现在我的世界里
带给我惊喜情不自已

可是你偏又这样
在我不知不觉中悄悄的消失

从我的世界里没有音讯
剩下的只是回忆
你存在我深深的脑海里
我的梦里我的心里我的歌声里

你存在我深深的脑海里
我的梦里我的心里我的歌声里

还记得我们曾经
肩并肩一起走过那段繁华巷口
尽管你我是陌生人是过路人
但彼此还是感觉到了对方的
一个眼神一个心跳
一种意想不到的快乐

好像是一场梦境命中注定
你存在我深深的脑海里
我的梦里我的心里我的歌声里

你存在我深深的脑海里

我的梦里我的心里我的歌声里

世界之大为何我们相遇

难道是缘分难道是天意

你存在我深深的脑海里

我的梦里我的心里我的歌声里

你存在我深深的脑海里
我的梦里我的心里我的歌声里

你存在我深深的脑海里
我的梦里我的心里我的歌声里



又是你的面孔 带给我是笑容

在我哭泣的时候

又是你的问候 带给我是感动
在我孤寂的时候

虽然没有天生一样的

但在地球上我们是一样的

尽管痛的苦的没说的

但哪有一路走来都是顺风的
因为我们没有什么不同
天黑时我们仰望同一片星空

没有追求和付出哪来的成功
谁说我们一定要走别人的路
谁说辉煌背后没有痛苦
只要为了梦想不服输
再苦也不停止脚步
又是你的面孔 带给我是笑容
在我哭泣的时候

又是你的问候 带给我是感动
在我孤寂的时候

虽然没有天生一样的

但在地球上我们是一样的

尽管痛的苦的没说的

但哪有一路走来都是顺风的
因为我们没有什么不同

天黑时我们仰望同一片星空

没有追求和付出哪来的成功
谁说我们一定要走别人的路
谁说辉煌背后没有痛苦

只要为了梦想不服输
再苦也不停止脚步

每一天 每一年 都可以是新的起跑线

也可以是终点 看你怎么选

望着无边无际遥远的地平线

哪里会是你的极限

我们没有什么不同

天黑时我们仰望同一片星空

没有追求和付出哪来的成功
谁说我们一定要走别人的路
谁说辉煌背后没有痛苦

只要为了梦想不服输
再苦也不停止脚步望星空

我们没有什么不同

天黑时我们仰望同一片星空

没有追求和付出哪来的成功
谁说我们一定要走别人的路
谁说辉煌背后没有痛苦

只要为了梦想不服输
再苦也不停止脚步

Ça me rend triste d'aller mieux
Ça m'éloigne de toi
J'oublie l'odeur de tes cheveux
Et le son de ta voix
Ça me rend triste mais je vais mieux
Même que parfois je pense plus à toi
Quelques secondes et je m'en veux
Dès que tu t'évapore de moi
Ça me rend triste d'être heureuse
Je sais que ça ne se dit pas
Ça me rend triste d'être heureuse sans toi
Ça me rend triste d'être heureuse
Je sais que ça ne se dit pas
Ça me rend triste d'être heureuse sans toi
两个人桌子的晚餐
一个人的晚安
梦中Casually寒暄
你的笑容还是那样的温暖
再过一分
再过一秒
仿佛闻到快乐的味道
睁开双眼梦醒时分
面对现实我无处可躲逃
微风吹来
 双臂拥抱
呼吸你的心跳
却转身发现我
独自在舞蹈
Ça me rend triste d'être heureuse
Je sais que ça ne se dit pas
Ça me rend triste d'être heureuse sans toi
一醉方休
只有歌唱
故想狂欢到天亮
Ça me rend triste d'être heureuse sans toi
却发现自己一个人在舞蹈

他们说一切都是最好的安排
就让爱教我学会忍耐
我愿意承受所有绝望与苦难
如果一切是最好的安排
指尖下冰冷的键盘孤独地苍白
微弱烛心随风摇摆
无处可归地徘徊
笔尖下的泪滴洇开难绘你色彩
像是一枚坠落尘埃
渺小到我已不存在
他们说一切都是最好的安排
就让爱教我学会忍耐
我愿意承受所有绝望与苦难
如果一切是最好的安排
你走那天我的灵魂陷入了长眠
昏睡四季没有呼吸
只有你能唤我苏醒
我时常想象你再次出现的场景
晴天突然下起大雨
冲刷干净这些年所有委屈
他们说一切都是最好的安排
就让爱教我学会忍耐
我愿意承受所有绝望与苦难
如果一切是最好的安排
想要看到你的微笑
想要你为我骄傲
想要回到你最温暖安全的怀抱
我不要看到你变苍老
我不要再听说你煎熬
给我最后答案
让这无奈不公画上句号
他们说一切都是最好的安排
为何我却开始恐惧等待
原谅我内心深处不完美的斑纹
眼看时间磨出一道裂痕
如果说一切都是最好的安排
那就让爱教会我学会忍耐
我愿意承受所有绝望与苦难
如果一切是最好的安排
我还在等待那个最好的安排

Your name gives it away
You're my sun and my moon, the bright light of my every day
And I was your girl, still am your girl
Until the end of time

I will fight for you pray for you cry for you I got love for you
I don't care what people say

Still remember the time
Had that bad dream again
You held me close got me through the night
Just give me a chance to show you the world

I'll always be your girl

You taught me wrong from right
It's never black or white
But through the lies, truth is what you'll find
Didn't always see eye to eye
But still you sacrificed
You took the fall
To watch me fly
And I will write this song sing this song play this song for you
Can you hear me over there
I'm dying over here
I will fight for you pray for you cry for you I got love for you
I don't care what people say
I don't care what people say
I'll always be your girl
oh...I'll always be your girl

Always your girl
Forever your girl
One and only girl
I'll always be forever be your one and only girl

On the edge for you …
带我去 一个地方
穿过蓝色的忧伤
看不清未来在哪里
唯一安慰我的是你
从此不再孤寂
On the edge for you…
Now we stand, stand, stand…
On the edge for you…
Every step that I take
I go all out, I don’t stall out
Get close enough to I brake
I’m off like everything’s at stake
Money down on my fate
Keep my passion over these fakes
Down that love avenue, your latitudes
All I need is that taste
On the edge
Off the feds
Follow me way off the grid
GPS way off the ledge
We the movement for all the heads
Breaking every law for this
Aim for greatness and I wont miss
Gotta raise that fist
On the edge till my people lift
带我去 一个地方
穿过蓝色的忧伤
看不清未来在哪里
唯一安慰我的是你
从此不再孤寂
On the edge for you…
Now we stand, stand, stand…
On the edge for you

You keep on talking I'll give you something to feel on
We keep it moving synonymous with the neon
Everybody wish they on the level that we on
Wrist and neck all frozen like I've been sipping Freon
Cuz it's live
You and I
We could die
Who wants to live a million lives
When we're up so high
We're already kissing paradise
We're already kissing paradise
We're already kissing paradise
My body's screaming let's start up a conversation
Don't think about it just use your imagination
It's getting wavy you're taking me on vacation
This feels like heaven cuz baby we got it A1
Cuz it's live
You and I
We could die
Who wants to live a million lives
When we're up so high
We're already kissing paradise
We're already kissing paradise
We're already kissing paradise
kissing kissing paradise
kissing kissing paradise
kissing kissing paradise
kissing kissing paradise
kissing kissing paradise
kissing kissing paradise
Take me all the way just take it to the edge take my breath away until there's nothing left
Take me all the way just take me on a ride
When you're here with me I'm kissing paradise
Cuz it's live
You and I
We could die
Who wants to live a million lives
When we're up so high
We're already kissing paradise
We're already kissing paradise
We're already kissing paradise
We're already kissing paradise
We're already kissing paradise

Wouldn’t it be nice
To break without breaking you

Wouldn’t it be nice
To choose without losing you
Wouldn’t it be nice
To know that you want this too
Wouldn’t it be nice
If it didn’t hurt the way I do
So hard to breath
Sometime it feels like all this air’s not free
You’re on my lips the opposite of sweet
Tell me that you’re feeling
Tell me that you’re feeling it too

Wouldn’t it be nice to break without breaking you
Wouldn’t it be nice to choose without losing you
Wouldn’t it be nice to know that you want this too
Wouldn’t it be nice if it didn’t hurt the way I do

Wouldn’t it be nice
To love like I've loved you before

Wouldn't it be nice
To end without starting a war

So hard to breathe
Sometime it feels like all this air’s not free
You’re on my lips the opposite of sweet
Tell me that you’re feeling
Tell me that you’re feeling it too

Wouldn’t it be nice to break without breaking you
Wouldn’t it be nice to choose without losing you
Wouldn’t it be nice to know that you want this too
Wouldn’t it be nice
Wouldn’t it be nice
Wouldn’t it be nice
Wouldn’t it be nice
If it didn’t hurt
If it didn’t hurt
If it didn’t hurt
The way I do

Wouldn’t it be nice
Wouldn’t it be nice
Wouldn’t it be nice
Wouldn’t it be nice

Wouldn’t it be nice to break without breaking you
Wouldn’t it be nice to choose without losing you
Wouldn’t it be nice to know that you want this too
Wouldn’t it be nice
Wouldn’t it be nice
Wouldn’t it be nice

Hopeful and helpless inside
All at the same time,
It’s beautiful

We’re brave but we’re broke
We’re fire and frozen and scarred
That’s who we are
We’re powerful

Don’t forget to breathe
When the war has left you weak

Paint the sky stars
With your wild heart
'Cause you are the universe love so hard till it hurts even when everything’s bursting apart
Paint the sky stars with your wild heart

We’re fragile and fearless
Heroes and villains - we hide
So terrified
It’s incredible

We try and we mess up
But that doesn’t stop us, instead
We start again
It’s wonderful

Don’t forget to breathe
When the war has left you weak

Paint the sky stars
With your wild heart
'Cause you are the universe love so hard till it hurts even when everything’s bursting apart
Paint the sky stars with your wild heart

Nothing is perfect
You have been reckless
But it don’t mean you’re worthless
You’re a lightning force trapped in the dark
'Cause we are only human
Searching for reason
We’re born to resilient radiant brilliant and different

Paint the sky stars
With our wild heart
'Cause we are the universe love so hard till it hurts even when everything’s bursting apart
Paint the sky stars with your wild heart

Oh oh oh oh

Let me concentrate on you…

Let me distract you in the morning
Let me distract you in the evening
Whatever it takes to keep you high

Let me distract you when you’re sleeping
Until we synchronize our breathing
Whatever it takes to keep you high
I’m in it for life my ride or die

So let me concentrate on you
Sit back relax watch me move
Got you so messed up on my love
You know you can’t leave, won’t leave, don’t leave

Anything you want

You can have it all

Anything you want

You can have it all

You can have it all
Anything you want
I can give it to you
You can have it all

Let me distract you baby

I look in the mirror
Your lies showing through
Told me that I got so much to prove
You’ve broken my spirit
You painted me scars
Burned by your fire
Then you stole my spark (Don’t be like this)
Throw your stones I’ll turn them into stardust
I build a broken heart of armor
You can’t hurt me anymore
You can’t hurt me anymore
My heart has died a thousand times before
You can’t hurt me anymore
(You can’t hurt me now)
Said I was fragile
Made out of glass
But I’m a diamond
If you try me, yeah you’ll find that diamonds never crack
Step outta my way
Boy you’re history to me now
You can’t hurt me anymore
You can’t hurt me anymore
My heart has died a thousand times before
You can’t hurt me anymore
(You can’t hurt me now)
Throw your stones I’ll turn them into stardust
I build a broken heart of armor
You can’t hurt me anymore
You can’t hurt me anymore
My heart has died a thousand times before

You can’t hurt me anymore
You can’t hurt me anymore

All I wanted you to do was listen
'Cuz there’s nowhere else I rather be than in this bed having this conversation
I need a reaction
I try so hard to find a reason to stay here when I wanna disappear
I left all my words inside this moment
So will you listen?
Your body is here but your mind is somewhere else
Your eyes on me but you don’t see me at all
If I was born to make you happy
Then how come I don’t make you happy
If you say it’s time to let you go
I will set you free
And even when I say I love you
You know that I will always love you
If you say it’s time to let you go
I will set you free
What do I have to do to make you make me feel like I’m your number 1?
Whatever happened to forever?
Has forever come undone?
Your body is here but your mind is somewhere else
Your eyes on me but you don’t see me at all
If I was born to make you happy
Then how come I don’t make you happy
If you say it’s time to let you go
I will set you free
And even when I say I love you
You know that I will always love you
If you say it’s time to let you go
I will set you free
I’m standing right here, right here, right here in front of you
Heart in my hands, understand there’s nothing that I wouldn’t do
Oh tell me right now, right now, right now cuz I need to know
I’m about to break
I gotta let you go
(No…I wanna make you happy)
If I was born to make you happy
Then how come I don’t make you happy
If you say it’s time to let you go
I will set you free
And even when I say I love you
You know that I will always love you
If you say it’s time to let you go
I will set you free...
And I will set you free
I will set you free
And I will set you free
I will set you free

We don’t need to go out on the town
We can dance on the patio and sing at the top of our lungs
You don’t need this take it off take it off
We can go under the covers and make love to this song
I use to be a wild child
But for you I want to be tamed
Rolling solo was my style
And now you got me changing my ways
My mind just slipped drunk off your kiss
Never thought love would feel like this
Tripped up in your spell
Tonight I’m gonna keep you all to myself
All your waking dreams
Lie right here with me
We don’t need to go out on the town
We can dance on the patio and sing at the top of our lungs (hey)
You don’t need this take it off take it off
We can go under the covers and make love to this song (ow)
Fingertips electric
White lightning strike in your touch
Bodies magnetic
Call out my name make me blush
Lost in bliss drunk off your kiss
Never thought love would feel like this
Take my breath don’t stop
Right up to the edge put the world on pause
All your waking dreams
Lie right here with me
We don’t need to go out on the town
We can dance on the patio and sing at the top of our lungs (hey)
You don’t need this take it off take it off
We can go under the covers and make love to this song (ow)
We don’t need to go out on the town
We can dance on the patio and sing at the top of our lungs
You don’t need this take it off take it off
We can go under the covers and make love to this song (ow)
Oh (ooo la la)
We don’t need to go out on the town
We can dance on the patio and sing at the top of our lungs
You don’t need this take it off take it off
We can go under the covers and make love to this song (ow)
 (We don't need to go out on the town, we can make love to this song)
No need to go out, we can dance and sing,
you don’t need this, take it off, make love to this song
Oh (ooo la la)

Baby won't you come on over
Lay your head on my shoulder
Tell me how your day was share a little more let's get a little closer
Shut out all the haters
Burn them up like they're paper
Got me feeling that buzz got me spun love drunk losing my composure
We are on top of world right now
Don't never ever let me down
'Cuz I feel safe and sound in your arms
You got me feelin'
Afterglow afterglow
Give me more (the way you light me up now)
(You got me beggin')
Afterglow afterglow
Give me more (the way you light me up now)

Love these sheets when they're messy
Hate this bed when it's empty
I can make you skip work you come first say the word
Baby if you let me
We're get lost in the madness
You're so good you're the baddest
'Cuz you've been on my lips like a permanent kiss
Baby come and get me
We are on top of the world right now
I won't never ever let you down
You're always safe and sound in my arms
You got me feelin'
Afterglow afterglow
Give me more (the way you light me up now)
(You got me beggin')
Afterglow afterglow
Give me more (the way you light me up now)
This private heaven is only for two
You set my heart on fire now it's burning for you
'Cuz this love is timeless we're written in stone
Forever-afterglow
Forever afterglow

You got me feelin'
Afterglow afterglow
Give me more (the way you light me up now)

Afterglow afterglow
Give me more (the way you light me up now)
Afterglow afterglow

我的歌声里remix

你存在我深深的脑海里
 我的梦里 我的心里 我的歌声里
你存在我深深的脑海里
 我的梦里 我的心里 我的歌声里
呢个旋律系我脑海出现几百次
系我心里面噶地位你又知唔知
每晚你都会出现甚至令我失眠
呢种缠绵又会令我想见你一面
我试过 用音乐去表达自己
但系又有几首可以令你铭记
我用最温柔噶说唱去打动你
好似你都系仲系对我爱理不理
系我歌词唔好 定系我自己唔好
可唔可以比个机会我 同你走到最后
好似呢首歌甘可以唱入你心里面
可唔可以一齐已经成为我噶理念
尝试用一首歌噶时间去对你表白
最惊我未讲出口就已经say goodbye
人生漫长我肯定唔会对你放弃
一切限期 一切防备 全部都系放屁
你存在我深深的脑海里
 我的梦里 我的心里 我的歌声里
你存在我深深的脑海里
 我的梦里我的心里 我的歌声里
我记得你噶习惯 记得你噶时间
无左你可能世界都唔会变得完整
就系地球无左月球何来噶潮汐
可能我会为你变成下一个林夕
需要你噶支持 需要你噶鼓励
就好似之前我愿做埋你噶苦力
想你做我人生道路上噶指南针
没有你噶时候我都会对错不分
我要发奋令你过上最好噶日子
日日唔使do 都可以系度数下银纸
有咩烦恼等我一人自己去承受
因为同你挽手一起走已经足够
同你一起唱歌
一起研究 bo po mo fo
有时你会觉得我比其他人都啰嗦
我都唔会介意 因为对你先会话多
呢一首歌我要送比你
你存在我深深的脑海里
我的梦里 我的心里 我的歌声里
你存在我深深的脑海里
我的梦里 我的心里 我的歌声里
你存在我深深的脑海里
我的梦里 我的心里 我的歌声里
你存在我深深的脑海里
我的梦里 我的心里 我的歌声里
