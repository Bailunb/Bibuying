 "作曲 : 黄勇\n 作词 : 莫大伟\nAll alone, O my lost and lonely soul-mate.\nHear my words, you know that I must leave you.\nI promise you that our bond will never die,\nUntil my pain is vast as the sky.\nShow me praise, as you hold me in your memory.\nShow me hate, as you will forget me.\nYou’ll never know, all the empty roads I’ve wandered.\nMy heart is dark, but yearns to fly.\nStand by me, in the way you won my spirit.\nAbandon me, just as you gave me freedom.\nNo need to doubt all my lost and faded glory,\nMy soul is small, but longs to roam.\nSing a Song of Redemption\nEchoing far and wide.\nAll alone with our anguish,\nWe regain our pride.\nSing a Song of Redemption,\nThe river surging higher,\nSad soul lost in the torrent,\nRedeems our lost desire",
