 "作曲 : George Harrison\n 作词 : George Harrison\nI look at you all see the love there that"s sleeping\nWhile my guitar gently weeps\nI look at the floor and I see it need sweeping\nStill my guitar gently weeps\nI don"t know why nobody told you\nhow to unfold your love\nI don"t know how someone controlled you\nthey bought and sold you\nI look at the world and I notice it"s turning\nWhile my guitar gently weeps\nWith every mistake we must surely be learning\nStill my guitar gently weeps\nI don"t know how you were diverted\nyou were perverted too\nI don"t know how you were inverted\nno one alerted you\nI don"t know how you were diverted\nyou were perverted too\nI don"t know how you were inverted\nno one alerted you\nI look at the wings at the play you are staging\nWhile my guitar gently weeps\nAs I"m sitting here doing nothing but aging\nStill my guitar gently weeps",
