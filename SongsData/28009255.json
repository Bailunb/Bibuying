 "song_lyric": "How many roads must a man walk down\nBefore they call him a man\nHow many seas must a white dove sail\nBefore she sleeps in the sand\nHow many times must the cannon balls fly\nBefore they"re forever banned\nThe answer my friend is blowing in the wind\nThe answer is blowing in the wind\nHow many years must a mountain exist\nBefore it is washed to the sea\nHow many years can some people exist\nBefore they"re allowed to be free\nHow many times can a man turn his head\nAnd pretend that he just doesn"t see\nThe answer my friend is blowing in the wind\nThe answer is blowing in the wind\nHow many times must a man look up\nBefore he can see the sky\nHow many ears must one man have\nBefore he can hear people cry\nHow many deaths will it take\n"Till he knows that too many people have died\nThe answer my friend is blowing in the wind\nThe answer is blowing in the wind",
