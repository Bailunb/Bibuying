 "Every child in Valoran has heard the tale before\nAbout the crused mummy boy\nwho felt his heart no more\nSo sad and lorn, the helpless lad\nAmumu was his name\nHe ventured out to find a friend\nand learn about his bane\n\nFor many years, young Amumu traveled through the lands\nDetermined to make friends, if only they would understand\nBut even when Amumu stood upon the ledge of home\nHis hope would disappoint him\nand he would remain alone\nBut then the curse began to whisper in his ear\nAnd would confirm what was Amumu"s biggest fear\nIt pledged that never shall someone become his friend\nIt pledged that he shall be alone until his end\nThe sorrow and despair\nBecame too much to bear\nYeah..ah...\n\nThe moment when Amumu\nrealized what he had done\nToo late it was, for him, for them\nthe evil curse had won\nThe anger and the anguish overwhelmed his fragile soul\nAnd caused a wicked tantrum that he never could control",
