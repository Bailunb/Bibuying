 "song_lyric": "编曲：Ron Aniello\nI"m going back to the sunset strip\nA place I fell in love with a man\nI know I had to see him again\nSo I drove a thousand miles in a day\nFourteen hours seemed like a piece of cake\nCause I know in the end the price was worth the fight\nThere he was,
 standing with his puzzled eyes\nThen he closed the gaps between us,
 lips inches away\nSuddenly love struck me down\nMy knees hit the ground\nHe loved me back\nLike it was yesterday oh…\nLove struck me down\nI weep but no sound\nA long awaited love struck me down\nIt"s been three years since you left town\nHow"ve you been I hope life didn"t bring you down\nYou must have met someone like me by now\nSunday morning I was in bed\nLet the phone ring but it wouldn"t end\nI was mad,
 I picked up,
 it was you\n“Hey you,
 I am back for good now…”\nThen it brought me back to that day\nyour lips inches away\nSuddenly love struck me down\nMy knees hit the ground\nHe loved me back\nLike it was yesterday oh…\nLove struck me down\nI weep but no sound\nA long awaited love struck me down\nJust ask me to stay. I"ll stay for the night\nThere"s nowhere else I rather be than\nhere with your body next to mine\nHolding me tight…\nBack into your arms\nlove struck me down\nMy knees hit the ground\nHe loved me back\nLike it was yesterday oh…\nLove struck me down\nI weep but no sound\nA long awaited love struck me down\nA long awaited love struck me down\nA long awaited love struck me down",
