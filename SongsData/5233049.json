 "You're just too good to be true\nI can't take my eyes off you\nYou feel like heaven to touch\nI wanna hold you so much\nAs long as love has arrived\nAnd I thank God I'm alive\nYou're just too good to be true\nI can't take my eyes off you\n\nPardon the way that I stare\nThere's nothing else to compare\nThe sight of you leaves me weak\nThere are no words left to speak\nBut if you feel like I feel\nPlease let me know if it's real\nYou're just too good to be true\nI can't take my eyes off you\n\n\nI love you baby\nAnd if it's quite all right\nI need you baby\nTo warm a lonely night\nI love you baby\nTrust in me when I say\n\nOh pretty baby\nDon't bring me down I pray\nOh pretty baby\nNow that I've found you this day\nAnd let me love you baby\nLet me love you\n\nYou're just too good to be true\nI can't take my eyes off you\nYou feel like heaven to touch\nI wanna hold you so much\nAs long as love has arrived\nAnd I thank God I'm alive\nYou're just too good to be true\nI can't take my eyes off you\n\n\nI love you baby\nAnd if it's quite all right\nI need you baby\nTo warm a lonely night\nI love you baby\nTrust in me when I say\n\nOh pretty baby\nDon't bring me down, I pray\nOh pretty baby\nNow that I've found you this day\nOh pretty baby\nTrust in me when i say （it's） ok\n\nI love you baby\nAnd if it's quite all right\nI need you baby\nTo warm a lonely night\nI love you baby\nTrust in me when I say\n\nOh pretty baby\nDon't bring me down I pray\nOh pretty baby\nNow that I've found you this day\nAnd let me love you baby\nLet me love you",
