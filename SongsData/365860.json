 "Well it happened a few years ago\nWe"re still pen friends at 17 years old\nI waited for you everyday did you know\nI scared to call you anyway\nYou didn"t know\n\nThen we met in a rainy day\nI remember how you dress that day\nI forgot what I wanted to say\nwhen I saw your face\n\nIt"s just like happened yesterday\nBut now you fall away\nOh now you fall away\n\nWhere are you now\nWhy can"t we be ourselvs\nJust like yesterday?\nEdward good pen friends\nAnd did you ever believe me\nWhen I said I don"t need to be free\nIf you could only\nCould only stay with me\nI don"t need to be free\nIf you could stay with me\nIf you could stay with me",
