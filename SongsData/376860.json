 "It’s the crack on the wall\nAnd the stain on the cup\nThat gets to you in the very end\nEvery cat has it’s fall\nWhen it runs out of luck\nSo you can do with a touch of zen\nCoz when you’re screwed you’re screwed\nAnd when it’s blue it’s blue\nWhen it’s blue it’s blue\n\nYou’re a clown with a frown\nYou’re a nowwhere man\nYou float around and around in your nowhereland\nKnowing not where you’re going to\nCoz when you’re through you’re through\nAnd when it’s blue it’s blue\n\nSo my job is to me like to some of us\nWhat kryptonite is to superman\nI’m the type who would like never to grow up\nTo float around and around and around and around and around\n\nCoz when you’re through you’re through\nAnd when it’s blue it’s blue\n\nWhen it’s blue it’s blue……\nit’s blue……",
