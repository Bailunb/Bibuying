 "作词 GATES DAVID / 作曲 GATES DAVID\n\nAnd Aubrey was her name\n\na not so very ordinary girl or name\nBut who"s to blame\n\nfor a love that wouldn"t bloom\nfor the hearts that never played in tune\nLike a lovely melody that everyone can sing\ntake away the words that rhyme it doesn"t mean a thing\n\nAnd Aubrey was her name\n\nWe triped the light and danced togther to the moon\n\nbut where was June\n\nNo it never came around\n\nIf it did it never made a sound\n\nmaybe I was absent or was listening to fast\n\ncatching all the words but then the meaning going past\n\nbut god I miss the girl\n\nand I"d go a thousand times around the world\njust to be closer the her than to me\n\nAnd Aubrey was her name\n\nI never new her but I loved her just the same\n\nI loved her name\n\nWish that I had found the way\n\nand the reasons that would make her stay\n\nI have learned to lead a life apart from all the rest\n\nIf I can"t have the one I want I"ll do without the best\n\nBut how I miss the girl\n\nand I"d go a million times around the world\njust to say she had been mine for a day",
