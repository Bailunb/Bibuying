 "I wrote this song\nIt"s not too long\nCause i"ve been thinking about you\nI wrote this song\nMaybe I"m wrong\nTo be called all about you\nI don"t know what you think about me\nMaybe you think nothing at all\nBut maybe you could just lie to me\nWe could be in love you see\nIt"s a singalong song\nThat"s not too long\nIt"s when I think about you\nThen I hear song\nAnd you can sing alone\nBaby if you want to\nCause baby i wrote this\nI wrote this for you\nI wrote this song\nIt"s not too long\nCause I"m the one who loves you\nI wrote this song\nThis can"t be wrong\nI don"t want to smile without you\nI just want to make you happy\nMaybe you want nothing at all\nAnd How I wish that\nYou"re meant to be\nForever and a day with me\nIt"s a singalong song\nThat"s not too long\nIt"s when I Think about you\nThen I hear songs\nAnd you can sing alone along\nBaby if you want to\nCause baby i wrote this\nI wrote this for you\nIn every way you mean more to me\nThan you leave go\nGirl I do my best to show\nThese words are true\nAnd if you like to make a song\nAnd be a perfect harmony with me\nI find the greatest words to sing\nSo we could write our own romantic thing\nIt"s a singalong song\nThat"s not too long\nIt"s when I think about you\nThen I hear song\nAnd you can sing alone\nBaby if you want to\nCause baby i wrote this\nI wrote this for you\nIt"s Just a singalong song\nThat"s not too long\nIt"s when I think about you\nThen I hear song\nAnd you can sing alone\nBaby if you want to\nCause baby i wrote this\nI wrote this for you",
