 "song_lyric": "When you close your eyes and you go to sleep\nAnd it\\'s down to the sound of a heartbeat.\nI can hear the things that you're dreaming about.\nWhen you open your heart and the truth comes out.\n\nYou tell me that you want me.\nYou tell me that you need me.\nYou tell me that you love me.\n\nAnd I know that I\\'m right. I hear it in the night.\nI hear the secrets that you keep\nwhen you're talking in your sleep.\nI hear the secrets that you keep\nwhen you're talking in your sleep.\nWhen I hold you in my arms at night,\nDon't you know you're sleeping in the spotlight\nAnd all your dreams that you keep inside?\n\nYou're telling me the secrets that you just can't hide.\nYou tell me that you want me.\nYou tell me that you need me.\nYou tell me that you love me.\nAnd I know that I'm right. I hear it in the night.\nI hear the secrets that you keep\nwhen you're talking in your sleep.\nI hear the secrets that you keep\nwhen you're talking in your sleep.\nI hear the secrets that you keep\nwhen you're talking in your sleep.\nI hear the secrets that you keep\nwhen you're talking in your sleep.\nWhen you close your eyes and you fall asleep.\nEverything about you is a mystery.\nYou tell me that you want me.\nYou tell me that you need me.\nYou tell me that you love me.\nAnd I know that I'm right. I hear it in the night.\nI hear the secrets that you keep\nwhen you're talking in your sleep.\nI hear the secrets that you keep\nwhen you're talking in your sleep.\nI hear the secrets that you keep\nwhen you're talking in your sleep.",
