 "If I could save time in a bottle\n\nThe first thing that I like to do\n\nIs to save everyday till eternity passes away\n\nJust to spend them with you\n\nIf I could make days last forever\n\nIf words could make wishes come true\n\nI"d save everyday like a treasure\n\nAnd then again I would spend them with you\n\nBut there never seem to be enough time\nto do the things you want to do\nOnce you"ve found them\n\nI"ve looked around enough to know\nThat you"re the one I want to go through the time with\n\nIf I had a box\n\njust for wishes and dreams that had never come true\n\nThe box would be empty\nExcept for the memory of how they were answered by you\n\nBut there never seem to be enough time\nto do the things you want to do\nOnce you"ve found them\n\nI"ve looked around enough to know\nThat you"re the one I want to the go time through with",
