"song_lyric":
 "starry, starry night\npaint your palette blue and grey\n\nlook out on a summer"s day\nwith eyes that know the darkness in my soul\nshadows on the hills\n\nsketch the trees and the daffodils\ncatch the breeze and the winter chills\nin colors on the snowy linen land\n\nnow i understand what you tried to say to me\n\nhow you suffered for your sanity\nhow you tried to set them free\nthey would not listen, they did not know how\nperhaps they"ll listen now\nstarry, starry night\n\nflaming flowers that brightly blaze\nswirling clouds in violet haze\nreflect in vincent"s eyes of china blue\ncolors changing hue\nmorning field of amber grain\nweathered faces lined in pain\nare smoothed beneath the artist"s loving hand\nnow i understand what you tried to say to me\nhow you suffered for your sanity\n\nhow you tried to set them free\nthey would not listen, they did not know how\nperhaps they"ll listen now\nfor they could not love you\nbut still your love was true\nand when no hope was left in sight\non that starry, starry night\nyou took your life, as lovers often do\nbut i could have told you, vincent\nthis world was never meant for one\nas beautiful as you\nstarry, starry night\nportraits hung in empty halls\nframeless head on nameless walls\nwith eyes that watch the world and can"t forget\nlike the strangers that you"ve met\n\nall the ragged men in the ragged clothes\nthe silver thorn of bloody rose\nlie crushed and broken on the virgin snow\nnow i think i know what you tried to say to me\nhow you suffered for your sanity\nhow you tried to set them free\nthey would not listen, they"re not listening still\nperhaps they never will",
