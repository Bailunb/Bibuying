"song_lyric":
 "Procession moves on,\nthe shouting is over,\nPraise to the glory\nof loved ones now gone.\nTalking aloud as they sit round their tables,\nScattering flowers\nwashed down by the rain.\nStood by the gate\nat the foot of the garden,\nWatching them pass\nlike clouds in the sky,\nTry to cry out\nin the heat of the moment,\nPossessed by a fury\nthat burns from inside.\nCry like a child,\nthough these years make me older,\nWith children my time\nis so wastefully spent,\nA burden to keep,\nthough their inner communion,\nAccept like a curse\nan unlucky deal.\n\nPlayed by the gate\nat the foot of the garden,\nMy view stretches out\nfrom the fence to the wall,\nNo words could explain,\n no actions determine,\nJust watching the trees\nand the leaves as they fall.",
